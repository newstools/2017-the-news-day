THE adjudicators, who presided over submissions of the forthcoming edition of National Arts Merit Awards (Nama), set for February 18 at 7 Arts in Avondale, Harare, say there was mediocrity and lack of originality in a number of entries submitted. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOIn a statement accompanying the release of the nominees by the organisers, the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (Nacz) yesterday, spokesperson, Catherine Mthombeni said the adjudicators were, however, impressed by artistes collaborations in dance, music and film. Adjudicators applauded the geographic spread of entries across all genres and quality of artworks, despite limited resources, although in some sectors, like spoken word adjudicators noted some mediocrity and lack of originality in a number of entries, she said.Mthombeni said some key observations by the adjudicators were that digitisation has contributed to increased quality of submissions in film and, thus, contributing to improved levels of filming in the country, while high-cost production sectors like music, visual arts and film were considerably affected by the economy, thereby, contributing to a decline in the number entries.This year s edition of the awards has registered a decline of more than 300 entries, compared to last year s submissions, as only 775 entries were submitted across the country ahead of the November 30 deadline, a drop of 329 from 1 104 entries submitted for last year s edition. There is lack of consistency in female artistes in terms of productivity and presence, this is owing to various reasons, top among them being reluctance by promoters to support female artistes across the board, she said.Mthombeni said most music videos submitted for the awards were directed by foreigners and generally, the award for outstanding video is given to the director, but Nama does not award foreign practitioners. She said there had been an upsurge in online media houses and platforms.Among the nominees are NewsDay Features and Lifestyle Editor, Phillip Chidavaenzi, whose third novel, The Latter Rain, was nominated in Outstanding Fiction category, Arts reporter Sindiso Dube and NewsDay correspondent Tinashe Muchuri.
