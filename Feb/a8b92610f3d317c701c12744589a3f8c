Before dawn on Friday, US-led coalition aircraft reportedly destroyed the main water pipeline supplying the Syrian city of Raqqa, the so-called "Islamic State's" (IS) de facto capital located in northern Syria.Two bridges linking the city's southern flank to the countryside were also destroyed during ground-fighting between US-backed fighters and IS militants, observers reported Friday.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of on-the-ground activists to track Syria's war, reported clashes between IS fighters and the&nbsp;US-backed Kurdish-led Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) north of the city.

US-backed Kurdish-led fighters have led the ground offensive across the region, mostly north of the city. IS has held the city since January 2014.The latest attacks echo those conducted in Iraq late last year when government forces mounted an offensive to recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul from jihadis.

They called such acts "absolutely unacceptable."
