GWERU City Council says it needs about 4 000 drums of tar to resurface its dilapidated roads, but has only secured 60. BY Stephen ChadengaTown clerk, Elizabeth Gwatipedza, said the state of the city s roads was deplorable, adding it may take time before the local authority secures adequate material to service the roads. The drums of tar we have are just a drop in the ocean of what is required for road maintenance, she said. We will prioritise Senga Road, which is in a very bad state compared to other roads, but we are going to attend to all roads. Residents have been complaining about potholes, which have gone unattended in most suburban areas and the situation has worsened due to heavy rains.In recent years, the local authority said it was only able to maintain a third of its surfaced road network due to lack of capital.Last month, the government disbursed about $45 million towards rehabilitation of roads in eight provinces following a public outcry over the poor state of the country s road network.
