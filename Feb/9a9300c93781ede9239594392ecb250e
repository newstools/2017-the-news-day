The ICRC announced on Wednesday that it was suspending its aid activities in Afghanistan following the killing of six local staff members.Dominik Stillhart, the ICRC's director for worldwide operations, told the Reuters news agency: "As we speak our operations are on hold indeed, because we need to understand what exactly&nbsp;happened before we can hopefully resume our operations."The attack took place 35 kilometers (22 miles) west of the northern provincial capital of Shibirghan, the chief of the provincial police&nbsp;said.The men had been on their way to distribute hay for animals in areas hit by deadly snow storms&nbsp;when they came under attack in the&nbsp;Qushtepa district, said&nbsp;Mawlawi Lutfullah Azizi, a local governor.Another two staff members were unaccounted for after the attack, ICRC spokesman Thomas Glass said."We confirm that six ICRC staff were killed and two are missing," a tweet from the Red Cross said.&nbsp;Azizi added that the bodies of the Red Cross staff were recovered with the help of tribal elders, while efforts to retrieve the two captives are ongoing, also with the tribal elders' help.&nbsp;While the ICRC said it did not know who was responsible for the attack, Azizi told Reuters that the&nbsp;aid workers were attacked by suspected so-called "Islamic State" (IS) gunmen. Snow and ice have taken over in Afghanistan, with plains, forests and hills all transformed under a layer of brilliant whiteness. The capital, Kabul, is one of the regions changed into a winter landscape, its trees stretching branches clad in silvery raiment.The temperatures outside makes the warmth of a heated home seem tempting. These internally displaced Afghan girls are staying close to the stove, but still seem cold.Traveling by car has become quite an adventure, with snow wreaking havoc on traffic on a number of major roads. Even here, on the outskirts of the capital, Kabul, conditions for driving are perilous.The inclement weather has caused problems across much of the country. But snow has its positive side as well, as these young men can confirm.The poor security situation in many areas of Afghanistan has displaced thousands of people. They are among those to suffer most under the cold conditions, like this child in Kabul.The cold weather seems not to worry these students. They still gave a display of wushu on a hilltop in Kabul.Snow has fallen in huge quantities, with the government even declaring a public holiday because of the inconvenience. This gives people time to clear roofs so they do not collapse under the weight.These donkeys stand patiently in the snow while their owner fills a container with rainwater. They may be pleased that they have be given coats in addition to their natural protection.Another pleasure of snow is undoubtedly building snowmen. And this one standing near Qargha Lake on the outskirts of Kabul towers over its creators.Travel by any means has been made difficult by the weather. This man pushing his heavily loaded bike seems to feel that two wheels are inadequate on the slippery roads.This intrepid vegetable seller has not let himself be put off by the weather. But his customers seem understandably to prefer to remain indoors."Daesh [IS] is very active in that area," Azizi said.Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said his group was not involved in the attack and promised that Taliban members would "put all their efforts into finding the perpetrators."Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a suicide bomber blew himself up after being stopped outside a district headquarters in the eastern Paktia province, killing two civilians and wounding a policeman, according to Abdullah Asrat, the spokesman for the provincial governor.On Tuesday, a suicide bomber struck at the entrance to the Afghan Supreme Court in the capital, Kabul, killing at least 20 people and wounding more than 40.jbh, dm/sms (dpa, Reuters, AP, AFP)
