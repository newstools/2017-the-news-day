TECH Women Zimbabwe (TWZ) has partnered with social media giant, Facebook to bring digital literacy to women in the country and create awareness on better safety practices on social media. BY TATIRA ZWINOIRAThis comes as the organisation and Facebook, through its Southern African representative, are commemorating Safer Internet Day today in Mbare on the safe use of social media.Safer Internet Day was yesterday, with local celebrations set for today.TWZ founder, Aretha Mare told NewsDay yesterday that the partnership was brought about after Facebook identified her organisation to partner with to create safety awareness in the country. We got $500 for adverts on Facebook to promote the event and share on internet safety. This is our first time working with Facebook and we hope to continue working with them as TWZ after the event. We are looking at digital safety and digital literacy skills for women, she said.Mare said though they had not yet secured future sponsorship in writing, they were definitely looking forward to it .Facebook is providing financial and marketing support for them to use in raising awareness about online safety and create financial literacy for underserved women in the country. Facebook Africa public policy manager, Akua Gyekye said nothing was more important to us than the safety of the people who use Facebook . Every day, people come to Facebook to connect with people and issues they care about, and they should be able to do so in a safe, secure environment, Gyekye said.Facebook launched a series of initiatives to help make the internet a safer and a better place for people across Africa, particularly children and the youth.The social media platform is seeking to partner with public sector agencies and non-governmental organisations from across the continent under the theme Be The Change: Unite For A Better Internet.Mare said as more Zimbabwean women and girls go online to take advantage of the opportunities the internet offers, they empower themselves with knowledge, education and connections with others.Over 100 countries are participating in the effort to start conversations of online safety which is coordinated by the joint Insafe/INHOPE network, with the support of the European Commission, and national Safer Internet Centres across Europe and beyond.
