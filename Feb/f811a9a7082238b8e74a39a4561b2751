Cleric, Evan Mawarire, leader of #ThisFlag campaign, has demanded an apology from Information Communication Techonology minister Supa Mandiwanzira, for accusing him of skipping bail. Online/Staff ReporterThis follows Mandiwanzira s claims to British ambassador, Catriona Laing, that Mawarire breached his bail conditions in July last year, when he went into self-imposed exile in the United States.In a tweet posted on his official @PastorEvanLive account, the cleric said: @SupaCollinsM please retract and apologise for your shameful lie to @CatrionaLaing1 that I was arrested for breaching bail conditions. You have no shame? That was a reference to Mandiwanzira s claims last week to Laing that Mawarire s arrest proved there was rule of law in Zimbabwe because if you breach your bail conditions you will definitely get arrested .But, contrary to Mandiwanzira s claims, Mawarire was not on bail when he left Zimbabwe last July. Charges against him had been dropped. Mawarire was slapped with fresh charges of trying to overthrow President Robert Mugabe s government when he returned from exile on February 1. He is due in court on Friday.Mandiwanzira yesterday laughed off Mawarire s demands, saying: I am not aware of this demand and the basis of it. So I have no comment to make on News24 reports or a pastor who is on bail.
