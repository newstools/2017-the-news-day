US Senate Democrat Elizabeth Warren was told to sit down after reading a thirty-year-old letter criticizing the attorney general nominee&nbsp;Jeff Sessions. The letter was written by Coretta Scott King, the widow of murdered civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr - and it circulated all the more freely&nbsp;after the efforts to silence Warren in the chamber.&nbsp;The Senate chamber's Republican leader Mitch McConnell stopped the Massachusetts Democrat&nbsp;from reading the letter and accused Warren of having "impugned" Senator Sessions - invoking Senate Rule 19 that prohibits disparaging remarks against a fellow senator."The senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama, as warned by the chair," McConnell said.

With a Republican majority in the upper house of Congress, the Senate voted along party lines to uphold McConnell's ruling.Senator Warren was initially warned after reading from a statement by one of her predecessors, former Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy, in which Kennedy had labeled Sessions a disgrace.
