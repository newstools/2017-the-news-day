I performed at the awards last year. It was my first time to be on such a big stage. It exposed me to industry watchers and artistes who are reaching out to me for collaborations and other music projects, he said. This year I feel energised and confident. I believe I will make my presence felt after I release a couple of singles, videos and my debut album. Blasta, who is a police officer, said Tora Bag, will be produced by Sly at Mnandi Records.He said Tora Bag, which loosely translates to get the money , is a track for all hard working Zimbabweans, who thrive to make ends meet in harsh economic conditions. The song encourages Zimbabweans to never look back regardless of the harsh economic conditions. We should be focused on getting money from whatever we put our energy on, Blasta said.
