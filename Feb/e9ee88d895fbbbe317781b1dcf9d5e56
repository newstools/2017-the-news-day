Working with Taylor Wayne was nerve-wrecking because I did not know what to expect, especially with an international star, but the team we were working with was very helpful, he said.The track was recorded and mixed in November, before its official release in December.Mupaka is currently in the top 10 charts both in Tanzania and Nigeria, and is sitting on the number one spot on Ebony FM in the West African country.
