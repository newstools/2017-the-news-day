HARARE football giants Dynamos are set to tour either Zambia or Mozambique, where they are scheduled to play a series of friendly matches in readiness for the 2017 Premiership season. By Sports ReporterTeam manager, Richard Chihoro, confirmed they were planning to tour either of the two countries. We have been playing some friendly matches with some local teams, as we prepare for the upcoming season. But we need to test our preparedness with some teams outside the country. We think that will help us to gauge our strengths and weaknesses. So we have an option to either go to Zambia or Mozambique. We are still weighing up the available options and we should be leaving after our ZNA Charities match against Caps United, he said.Dynamos are scheduled to clash with their old foes Caps United in the semi-final of the Zimbabwe National Army Charity Shield at the end of the month.Bulawayo giants, Highlanders are set to clash with league runners-up, FC Platinum in another semi-final.The Glamour Boys want to emulate their counterparts Caps United and FC Platinum, who have engaged teams from outside the country.
