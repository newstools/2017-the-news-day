The fighting took place inside the compound. A third fighter escaped and we are pursuing him. All the people in the hotel are safe," Mohamed said.Witnesses told the Somali website Garowe Online that officials from Dubai Port World (DP)&nbsp;were present in the hotel at the time but weren't&nbsp;injured&nbsp;in the clash.Somalia's semi-autonomious region of PuntlandPuntland being drawn into conflictPuntland has been relatively stable compared to the rest of Somalia but attacks by terrorist groups&nbsp;have started to pose risks to the stability of the region.Residents in the region told reporters last week for example that they had found three headless bodies, days after reportedly IS-linked fighters had abducted nine people.Until 2011, the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab controlled most of Somalia including the capital, Mogadishu, but since 2015 African Union and Somali government forces have forced it out of key urban strongholds.Al Shabaab&nbsp;aims to overthrow the Western-backed government and impose its&nbsp;own strict interpretation of sharia - Islamic law - on the nation.Somalia's parliamentarians are due to&nbsp;elect a president&nbsp;later on Wednesday in Mogadishu.jbh/msh (dpa, Reuters)
