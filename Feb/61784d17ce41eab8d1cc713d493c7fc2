Once Latin America's largest construction company, it has been linked to bribing officials in 12 Latin American countries, and is one of the companies&nbsp;at the center of the Operation Car Wash scandal that has engulfed Brazil. Odebrecht admitted in a US court in December that it distributed hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to secure construction contracts across the continent, and agreed to pay billions in fines.Authorities in Peru and throughout Latin America have been moving fast to charge officials accused of taking some $800 million in bribes that Odebrecht acknowledged paying in the plea agreement signed with the US Justice Department.Other Peruvian leaders have been linked to bribes from Odebrecht in recent months. The company said it provided $29 million in bribes to Peru. The bribes may also allegedly implicate previous Peruvian presidents Alan Garcia and Ollanta Humala.Garcia has denied wrongdoing, but a number of individuals&nbsp;have been accused of accepting bribes from Odebrecht during Garcia's 2006-2011 presidency.&nbsp;kbd/ (AP, Reuters) Send Facebook Twitter Google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink http://dw.com/p/2UjUG
