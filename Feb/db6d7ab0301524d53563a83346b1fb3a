DENDERA exponent, Sulumani Chimbetu and Barura Express frontman, Tendai Dembo will tomorrow launch their new albums, Jamboree and Mushando respectively, at a live performance set for the Legends Sports Diner in Marondera. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMADendera King Sulumani ChimbetuThe gig, dubbed Jamboree Pamushando is expected to draw many fans, given the high attendance witnessed during their previous outings in the town, located 72km east of Harare. This will be the first time the duo would be performing at the venue since launching their new albums. Show promoter, Daniel Masaiti said he thought it wise to bring the two under one roof, so that the fans will have a feel of their latest offerings. Sulu and Tendai held joint shows in Marondera last year, but that was before they had launched their new albums. They only sampled the songs, but it is now time for the fans to have a feel of the final product. The show is an honour to their fans this side, who have been anticipating this day. This is the first show of a high magnitude this year and people are ready for it, he said.Sulu, the son of the late dendera king, Simon Chimbetu, is flying high with the album titled Jamboree with hits including Alice Mbewe, Tiringwe and Mhasuru.Dembo, who took over from his father Leonard, released his second album Mushando late last year, with the title track Mushando proving to be a potential hit.Both artistes are also expected to perform renditions by their late fathers, as has been the culture. I am glad that I will be sharing the stage with Sulu and that both of us will be presenting our new albums to our legion of fans. We have performed a couple of times in Marondera and I am confident that we are going to attract numbers because of the new albums, Dembo said.
