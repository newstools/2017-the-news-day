LOCAL designer, Quentine Nyoni has won $1 000 and will attend the African Union (AU) summit s 28th ordinary session for designing a logo that best illustrates the African Union s theme of the year, Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investments in Youth. BY LORRAINE MUROMOQuentine Nyoni (right) and Mahama OuedraogoNyoni said his designs symbolised unity and diversity in Africa, particularly among the youths, regardless of gender differences. The element of hands and different gender symbols reaching towards each other demonstrates the desire of Africa s young men and women to work together towards harnessing the demographic dividend, he said in a Press statement.Nyoni said Africa was experiencing a youth bulge and was likely to continue on that trajectory, adding that the red, green, blue, pink, yellow and black paint splatters on the design denoted youthfulness and conveyed the diversity of Africa s peoples. He said his dream was to launch a multimedia company, through which he will foster talent in other young Zimbabweans. I can teach them what I know, especially those with little education. Graphic design is a small sector here in Zimbabwe, so I would love to encourage other young people and develop their capacity, so that when the next opportunity like this comes around, they can also have the chance to have the same life-changing experience as me, he said.Nyoni added that he would be happy to work for an international organisation, such as the African Union or United Nations, as long as it was for the betterment and development of the people. The logo design contest was launched by the AU s Commissioner of Human Resources, Science and Technology, Martial De-Paul Ikounga, during the 2016 Africa Youth Day commemoration on November 1.The official 2017 AU theme logo will feature on communication materials and publications throughout the year and beyond by a wide array of stakeholders.
