The former squat on Rigaer Strasse 94 in Berlin - one of the last such leftist strongholds in Europe - has won another day in court. The owner's lawyer couldn't prove he was entitled to represent the case. Fire rescue officials on Sunday said three men died in a fire that broke out at a sauna club in the German capital of Berlin.Emergency services received the first call about the fire at 22:30 (2130 UTC).It is unclear how the fire erupted at the Steam Works club, located in the basement of a 10-storey building in the central Berlin district of Sch neberg, authorities said. Other parts of the building were not affected by the blaze, they added.Firefighters had to cut through a steel gate in order to access the club, the Berlin-based "BZ" newspaper reported.A spokesman for emergency response services said some 50 firefighters combed through the small rooms of the 2,000-square-meter&nbsp;club.Nearly 30 people were at the club at the time the fire broke out.&nbsp;ls/bw (dpa, BZ
