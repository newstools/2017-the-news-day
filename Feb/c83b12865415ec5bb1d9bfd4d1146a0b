Angela Merkel's brief visit to Warsaw on Tuesday marked the German leader's first trip to Poland since a populist government was elected there&nbsp;in 2015.With trade between the two countries booming, Merkel's trip has been widely seen as a chance for&nbsp;Berlin and Warsaw to continue nurturing the slowly-improving&nbsp;diplomatic relations.Following a 60-minute talk with Merkel, leader of the governing&nbsp;Law and Justice (PiS) party Jaroslaw&nbsp;Kaczynski said there was a "good atmosphere."Kaczynski, a politician deeply distrustful of Germany, once&nbsp;said the chancellor's goal was to make Poland subordinate to its western neighbour.Merkel meanwhile called&nbsp;on Poland's right-wing government on Tuesday to protect the rights&nbsp;of the political opposition as well as those of the justice system,&nbsp;trade unions and media, amid an investigation by the EU&nbsp;Commission&nbsp;into possible Polish violations of the rule of law.Russia sanctionsIn separate talks with&nbsp;Polish Prime&nbsp;Minister Beata Szydlo, Merkel addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The chancellor later told reporters that&nbsp;sanctions against Moscow over the ongoing conflict Ukraine&nbsp;cannot yet be lifted."The situation on the ground is still unacceptable," she said.Angela Merkel and Beata Szydlo stressed the importance of German-Polish tiesMerkel's comments came just hours after a telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which she urged Putin to&nbsp;use his influence on separatists in eastern Ukraine to bring an end to almost three years of violence. The two agreed, however, on the need for new ceasefire efforts.Poland against Nord Stream 2Despite being largely on the same page&nbsp;when it comes to Russia,&nbsp;the controversial Nord Stream 2&nbsp;project&nbsp;remains a contentious issue between Poland and Germany. Reiterating her country's stance on Tuesday,&nbsp;Szydlo said the Baltic Sea pipeline is "not acceptable to Poland."The&nbsp;deal would see&nbsp;Russia's state controlled energy giant Gazprom extend its pipeline to&nbsp;Germany, bypassing&nbsp;Poland, the Baltic states and Ukraine.

During the joint press conference,&nbsp;Szydlo&nbsp;said Poland is determined to further ties with Germany."I am confident that a good partnership between Poland and&nbsp;Germany is necessary for the success of the European project," Szydlo said."Poland and Germany ... have a huge role to play in the changes that are taking place in the Union," she added.While Poland and Germany both favor&nbsp;stronger security at EU borders, Merkel said&nbsp;she was "cautious about demands for EU treaty change."The German chancellor also warned against "exclusive clubs within the EU."Trans-Atlantic relationsTwo weeks into Donald Trump's presidency in the US, Merkel also addressed comments made by the newly-inaugurated president on Monday in which he said the US "strongly supports" NATO.
