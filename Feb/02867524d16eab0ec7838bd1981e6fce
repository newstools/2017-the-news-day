The hullabaloo over the new education curriculum continued this week, with the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe drawing up a petition to be handed over to Parliament. Comment: NewsDay EditorPrimary and Secondary Education minister Lazarus Dokora has insisted he did not reinvent the wheel and is only implementing the Nziramasanga Commission recommendations.That the education curriculum is long overdue for a revamp is an open secret, but the question is about implementation and the timing of it.The continuous noise over the issue is testament to that there was little or no consultation ahead of the curriculum changes.This points to a dysfunctional bureaucracy, as implementation of a new curriculum involves many players that is, teacher education colleges and universities, teachers themselves and the community as they all need to be involved in the new set-up.Unlike this fiasco, where there is a clear top-down approach, with teachers and the community not in the loop and the ministry ordering schools what to do.Dokora may feel he is exercising his authority, but the basics of policymaking point out that the players in this case the teachers, learners and the community must take ownership of decisions that affect them, as this will mean they will want them to succeed.The court cases and the petition to Parliament show that the relationship between the government, on one hand, and the educators, on the other, is broken and needs fixing and the only way to do that is through consultation.Educators, on the other hand, must accept that something needs to be done to revamp the curriculum, as Zimbabwe has been stuck on a 1980 one for far too long.There is need to include subjects like computer education and the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) across the board and move to e-learning, among other improvements, although mass displays which Dokora introduced as a compulsory subject belong to a bygone era.The process of improving the curriculum should include all stakeholders and should not just be sprung on people as a ministerial order.The Nziramasanga report, which is seen as the holy grail, also needs to be questioned and should not be just taken as is, as it was crafted in a totally different era from today, when ICTs were fairly nascent and the internet was still a novelty.It would be folly to take all its recommendations, as they may not apply in the present setting, considering the report was done in 1999, almost 20 years ago.This may explain why Dokora wants mass displays as an examinable subject, but clearly this has no place in a modern education system, but could have been seen as a brilliant idea two decades ago.
