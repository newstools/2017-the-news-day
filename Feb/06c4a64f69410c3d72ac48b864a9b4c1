I am happy to win all this at this age. I thank my mentor and guardian, Betex Manzinde, for taking me into his home and introducing me to pool. It is a big challenge when you get to play against older competitors and it always brings joy to me when I overcome them, which in turn gives me more confidence to face opponents of my age, he said.
