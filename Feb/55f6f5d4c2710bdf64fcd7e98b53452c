BY VENERANDA LANGA Biata NyamupingaThe Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Gender and Women Development made the disclosure, while submitting its 2017 National Budget report last week. The Gender Commission must be allocated $1,3 million for their operations and at a minimum there must be Treasury concurrence for the recruitment of the urgently required 20 members of staff with the requisite qualifications and experience, and funds to be availed for the six vehicles required for operations support, committee chairperson, Biata Nyamupinga said. The projected establishment for the commission is 52, however, currently, there are four officers, three of who are seconded from other ministries and one funded by a development partner, she said.

ZGC was allocated $105 000 for 2017.Part of its duties include public education on gender and awareness, investigating possibly violations of human rights related to gender, research, monitoring compliance with gender equality commitments, and institutional strengthening.
