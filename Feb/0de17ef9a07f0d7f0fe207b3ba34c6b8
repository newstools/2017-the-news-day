After a long sabbatical from the music industry, Sandra Ndebele has vowed that she is returning and will rock the stage once more. By Sindiso DubeSandra NdebeleSandy, as Ndebele is affectionately known, was in the studio last week, with one of the country s most sought-after producers, Oskid in Harare, working on a new track titled Ingoma featuring Afro-pop musician, Mzoe7.Sandy became a household name in the early years of her career, as she was known for her energetic stage appearances, clad in skimpy traditional outfits and performing dances with sexual innuendos.A confident Ndebele said this year is all about reclaiming her queen of Zimbabwean music status after new age dancers and musicians like Bev Sibanda, Zoey Sifelani and Lady Storm among others were dominating the industry. It s my year, I m marking my return, the return of the queen and up the ladder is where I am going. In my view, no one had taken my queen status, she said. I will be dropping new music, single after single and new videos, the first video to expect is for Ingoma packaged with new proper dance routines, great choreography and directed by Andy Cutta. Oskid on production is a bonus, everyone knows what he can do, he is the best and an all-rounder, when it comes to sound. Quizzed if she will keep up with the ever-changing music industry in terms of sound, dances and new marketing strategies, she replied: It s all about moving with times now. On Ingoma, Sandy features Bulawayo-based Afro-pop musician, Mzoe 7, whom she described as a talent and hardworking musician. Mzoe7 is a talented young man with a lot of energy and he loves working hard every time. He is a sober-minded artiste, who is passionate about music and makes sure he betters his previous works, she said.
