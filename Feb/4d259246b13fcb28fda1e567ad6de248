We are going to train our Zimra staff on how to analyse accounts and books of multi-nationals. We are trying to zero in on where the capital outflow is from the continent, he said. we need to look at what they charge in management fees. Is it the same everywhere, what is the formula used to charge on brands? Our interest is whether we are treated fairly. Chinamasa said Treasury came across a scenario where management fees were 10% of gross revenue, although he would not name and shame the company involved. I have said to multinationals we are just looking for a fair playing field, let s have dialogue and my office is open, he said.Chinamasa said some of the so-called investments by foreign companies were coming in as loans . He said a Zimbabwean company was opened, which would borrow offshore, thereby, burdening the country.Multi-nationals stand accused of fleecing African countries through under-invoicing and transfer pricing.
