HARARE City Council has recommended that acting directors be appointed to substantive positions despite internal heckling over possible salary reductions, NewsDay has established. BY XOLISANI NCUBEHarare mayor, Bernard ManyenyeniCouncil has been operating with three substantive directors, while other departments including that of town clerk are headed by employees on acting capacities.Chairperson of the human resources committee, Wellington Chikombo, said council has submitted a list of candidates, who should be appointed to fill vacant posts. We have done our part and we now await direction from the government on the matter, he said without divulging the names of those who made it after the interviews.Chikombo and mayor, Bernard Manyenyeni, have been at each other s throats over the latter s support for the reduction of salaries for council staff, including directors, something the Glen Norah councillor is against.Among those believed to have made the list are acting director for water, Simon Muserere, Tendai Kwenda (finance) and interim housing boss, Arthur Marara.Harare remains in a sticky situation over the town clerk s position following a stillborn bid to appoint banker, James Mushore, that was torpedoed by Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere last year. The matter is still pending at the High Court, but Mushore is still regarded as a council employee.Meanwhile, council has pleaded with residents to approach city authorities with payment plans for outstanding bills.Council spokesperson, Michael Chideme, yesterday said council has engaged debt collectors to recover more than $600 million owed by residents. Council has always been available for debt discussions. Customers having difficulties in paying their debts should make payment arrangements at their nearest district offices and ensure they pay the current bill, he said.
