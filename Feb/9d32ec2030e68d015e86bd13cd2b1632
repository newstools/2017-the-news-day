GOSPEL musician, Togarepi Chivaviro has said he will take a break from music to focus on his growing ministry, Assemblies of Pentecostal Methodists, which has since spread its branches in Zimbabwe, Botswana, the United Kingdom and South Africa, where he is based. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMASpeaking to NewsDay on the sidelines of his birthday celebrations held at the Anglican Cathedral in Harare at the weekend, Chivaviro said he was not quitting music altogether. Let me set the record straight. I am aware of the information that spread around to the effect that I am going to quit, that is not correct, he said. I was only going to take a break from production and shows for a number of years, due to pressure of work. I am running a ministry, which now has 25 assemblies in four different countries and I was supposed to undertake some major studies this year as well. Chivaviro said he had no choice, but to temporarily sacrifice one of his three engagements ministry, studies and music.Famed for the hit track Ebenezer-Tirimunyasha, Chivaviro said he had also temporarily postponed his studies so that he would have time to record a new album in honour of his fans. Because of the postponement of commencement of studies, I found myself with some breathing space and I immediately got back into studios in South Africa and recently in Zimbabwe to complete the rest of the songs to make Maranatha, an album, he said.The eight-track album will be launched on March 11 at Germiston Prayer Centre in South Africa before another launch on April 11 at the Anglican Cathedral Church in Harare.The new album will contain the recently released track Maranatha, a song that featured local musicians Munyaradzi Munodawafa, Mathias Mhere and Agatha Murudzwa, among others.
