FORMER Southern Eye correspondent, Admire Kudita, has turned to television with the launch of a pilot television show titled Live and Fluid on Stage, set to hit the small screen soon. BY SINDISO DUBEAdmire KuditaLive and Fluid is an entertainment variety show produced and hosted by Kudita, popularly known as Mr Kay.It has several videos posted on popular video-sharing platform YouTube.Kudita said the show was a multi-genre showcase of curated performances in music, dance and spoken word. The show is based on the belief in our local and African creative content. The human resource element is undeniable, so the concept is a vehicle to transport creative content into the living rooms of African homes, he said. The idea, therefore, is for our story tellers to get busy. Live and Fluid offers family-friendly entertainment paradigm for viewers. Kudita expressed hope that with the new wave of digital media, new content producers and new television shows like Live and Fluid would get a chance to shine. New channels like Kwese TV represent opportunities for content producers like me to work and shine. Digitisation itself is a vast opportunity in the sense that the spectrum for content is much larger, he said. I am currently in talks with different stations and I was shortlisted to be part of the Zim Digital training workshops, on the basis of my submitted concepts. Kudita emphasised that he was not trading the notebook for the small screen. All television is based on writing, so it can t be said that I traded the notebook. Besides, entertainment journalism is pure art and creative writing, he said. Live and Fluid is the brainchild of Culture Beat Africa Multimedia and intends to benefit the African society and artistes.
