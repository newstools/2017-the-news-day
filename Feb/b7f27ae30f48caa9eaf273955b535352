European neighbors Germany and France plan to test self-driving vehicles on a section of road linking the two countries, the transport ministry in Berlin said Wednesday.The route stretches around 70 kilometers (43 miles), from Merzig in Germany's western Saarland state to Metz in eastern France. It is aimed at testing "automated and connected driving in real cross-border traffic," the ministry noted."Manufacturers will be able to test the connectivity of their systems, for example when lanes or speed limits change at the border," German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said in a statement following a meeting with his French counterpart Alain Vidalies."We want to set worldwide standards for this key technology through cooperation between Europe's two biggest car-producing countries," he added.The route will allow testing of 5G wireless communications between cars and infrastructure, automated maneuvers such as overtaking and braking, and emergency warning and call systems, among others.
