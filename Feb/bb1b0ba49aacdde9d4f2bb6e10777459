I believe 110 % we can do this (qualify for the World Cup). A lot of the ladies are raring to go. I am very confident in the team and the support staff around me that they will help me lead the team as well as get the result that we want, she told reporters.Zimbabwe, who are pitted against India, Ireland, Sri Lanka and Thailand in Group A, will be looking to finish among the top three teams to progress to the Super Six stage for the final qualifying round.Only the top four teams at the Super Six stage will book tickets to the England finals slated for June 26 to July 23 this year.Mayers expressed confidence that the testing sub-continent conditions in Sri Lanka would work to the team s advantage. For our bowling department, it (the conditions) will definitely work to our advantage because we do have a lot of spinners in our side. In terms of our batting, it will be an interesting mix. We have to face some challenges, but I do believe the girls will all come through, she said.Coach, Trevor Phiri said the team had been working a lot on the batting, which has been a letdown for a long time, the focus being on playing spin, coming up with combinations, as well as keeping wicket, among other things.Zimbabwe leave for Sri Lanka tomorrow with a 14-member squad that has a number of experienced players including Tasmeen Granger, Precious Marange, Ashley Ndiraya, Josephine Nkomo and MayersGroup B at the ICC Women s World Cup qualifiers has Bangladesh, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Scotland and South Africa fighting for a place in the Super Six stage.Hosted in Colombo, the tournament will run from February 7 to February 23.Zimbabwe team:Sharne Mayers (captain), Precious Marange, Esther Mbofana, Pellagia Mujaji, Modester Mupachikwa (wicketkeeper), Marry-Anne Musonda, Nomatter Mutasa, Ashley Ndiraya, Josephine Nkomo, Nonhlanhla Nyathi (wicketkeeper), Loreen Tshuma, Tasmeen Granger, Nomvelo Sibanda and Anesu Mushangwe.
