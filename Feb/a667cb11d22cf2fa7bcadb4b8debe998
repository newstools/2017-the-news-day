The Romanian government has repealed its controversial corruption ordinance. Hundreds of thousands of people have been protesting peacefully for days. DW's Robert Schwarz believes they want more than just repealing the decree and the government should take note. Tens of thousands of protesters gathered on Sunday to protest the government's actions aimed at watering down anti-corruption laws in the former communist nation.Although Romanian Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu withdrew the decree, demonstrators have continued to gather across the nation, including in the cities of Cluj, Sibiu and Timisoara.The rallies marked the 13th consecutive day of protests against the controversial decree, which would have criminalized abuse of power only if the sums involved exceeded approximately 44,000 euros ($41,350).The demonstrations mark the largest since 1989, when communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted and later executed in the wake of anti-government protests.Justice Minister Florin Iordanche resigned on Thursday in an attempt to appease Romanians who have criticized the decree as an attempt to water down anti-corruption laws.Since the former communist nation's ascension to the EU in 2007, Brussels has pushed Bucharest to continue democratic reforms and weed out political corruption.Romania has since appointed a prosecutor to the National Anticorruption Directorate, which has investigated former ministers and senior officials, and seen them convicted on corruption charges.Romania ranked 57 out of 176 countries on graft watchdog Transparency International's 2016 corruption perceptions index.
