EU leaders on Friday adopted tactics to foil traffickers who have steered more than half a million mainly African migrants across the Mediterranean Sea toward Europe over the past three years.Rights groups warned of troubling consequences.The plans&nbsp;include boosting&nbsp;Libyan coast guard interceptions&nbsp;of the often unseaworthy boats traffickers load migrants onto, the setting up of "safe" refugee camps in Libya, and "voluntary" repatriations for refugees persuaded to return to their countries of origin.EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the plan aims to "decrease loss of life at sea and in the desert" of southern Libya.Summit participants also noted an accord reached on Thursday between Italy and Libya, including coast guard training and medical services for camps.EU leaders discussed migration and Trump in MaltaGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the plans and said that a European solution to the refugee crisis was beginning to take shape. Europe's destiny was "in its own hands," said&nbsp;Merkel, who on Thursday had visited Turkey, which since March 2016 has largely shut the Aegean-Balkans route in a multibillion-euro deal with Brussels.However, she warned that "a lot of work still remains to be done," adding&nbsp;that increased cooperation with&nbsp;Libya's regional neighbors was imperative.The summit also focused on deep policy discord between the EU and US President Donald Trump, including his temporary bans on accepting all refugees and migrants from seven mostly Muslim nations. Common EU policies on asylum and migration were aims stated in the bloc's Lisbon Treaty&nbsp;signed in 2007&nbsp;but were not initially implemented. Thousands of deathsLast year, 180,000 people sought to reach Europe from North Africa. Some 4,500 people died, often during capsizes of fragile and overloaded boats.Fatalities during the past three winter months had averaged 15 a day, said the UN Refugee Agency. Among the unprecedented 1,354 who died were 190 children, according to UNICEF.As leaders met Friday in Malta, the crews of civilian rescue ships off Libya said efforts to save people, including babies, remained an "absolute nightmare."Traffickers were sending them offshore in increasingly unseaworthy vessels to maximize profits, rescuers said. On the eve of the summit alone, more than 1,750 migrants had been rescued.
