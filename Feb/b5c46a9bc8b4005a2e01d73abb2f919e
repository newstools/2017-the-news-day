BY RONALD MAGWETAPee Kay with representatives from Oasis waterPee Kay, who is known for his hit track, Tobhigwa Nemamonya, told NewsDay that Oasis bottled water will now be branded Oasis mvura yemamonya. He said he was excited at the new deal, which was of mutual to benefit to the two parties. I am really happy about the development and what make it charming is that Oasis water is still growing and I like to be associated with growth, he said. The deal made sense because it has something to do with me as a brand and I had stopped making music and was concentrating on developing my brand behind the scenes. Oasis sales and marketing manager, Tapiwa Muparaganda, said: As Oasis we believe our Oasis Sport makes sense to make Pee Kay the brand ambassador because the sports brand resonates well with Pee Kay s image, the Bhigwa Nemamonya and we also believe that our clientele and Pee Kay s fans can both relate. Of course, it s a brand we re building, which is edgy and new and modern, that s the artistic style we believe Pee Kay also has. He said, as a young and innovative company, they were planning to compete against major players in the industry, so they needed to be more aggressive. We are a young and innovative company, we know for us to be able to compete against the big giants, we have to be more aggressive, we have to move faster and be innovative and that s exactly we see Pee Kay doing, he said.Pee Kay is currently working on some new music and videos set to be released later this year.
