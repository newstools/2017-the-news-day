Bosso boss, Dube, was suspended in November last year, following allegations of inappropriate conduct at the Zifa congress on October 29 during the Premier Soccer League (PSL) promotion/relegation debate.Former Warriors coach, Gorowa, Kasinauyo and Nation Dube had been accused of having been part of a plan to fix the Zimbabwe, Swaziland Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers last year.Dube was also accused of helping fix the Warriors matches at the African Nations Championships (Chan) in Rwanda early last year.Also off the hook are Bulawayo City head coach, Philani Ncube and chairman, Jerry Sibanda, who were suspended following allegations of match-fixing in a league game against Border Strikers at Dulivhadzimu in Beitbridge last August.Farai Mujokoro, who was assistant coach to Ncube, and kit manager, Gift Mvala were handed five-year bans by the PSL disciplinary committee after they were found guilty of match-fixing involving that game.Chiyangwa made the announcements when he addressed journalists at a hotel in Bulawayo yesterday following a meeting with Zifa councillors and the PSL on Thursday night. The lifting of the following suspensions, which I am recommending to my congress, is with immediate effect: the suspension of Edzai Kasinauyo, Nation Dube, Ian Gorowa, Jerry Sibanda and Philani Ncube are lifted. The suspension and expulsion of Ndumiso Gumede is lifted. The suspension of Peter Dube has been referred to the review committee with immediate effect, he said in his brief address before leaving for the first Council of Southern Africa Football Associations (Cosafa) executive meeting scheduled for yesterday and today in South Africa.Chiyangwa said the main purpose of his visit to Bulawayo was to tour facilities ahead of the fifth edition of the Cosafa Women s Championship to be hosted by Zimbabwe in August and he needed notes regarding the facilities for the meeting in South Africa. I had a tour of some interesting places, which we are looking forward to using for our Cosafa women s games. The Cosafa women s games will primarily be domiciled in the southern region. So most of what was going on is that we were conferring with councillors, who are going to be active in ensuring that the Cosafa games are a success. They are going to be domiciled more in the southern and central regions. That is why primarily I came here so that I could confirm as I am on my way to the first Cosafa meeting, he said.
