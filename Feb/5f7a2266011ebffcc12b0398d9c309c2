The top Democrat and Republican lawmakers on the US Senate Judiciary Committee asked for copies late Wednesday of the transcripts of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn's intercepted calls with Russian contacts.Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa and Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein of California sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director James Comey requesting documents and a briefing on Flynn's departure.Noting that both the FBI and the Justice Department were involved in events leading up to Flynn's resignation, the senators said the reports raised "substantial questions" about the former adviser's discussions with Russian officials.GOP growing anxiousRepublicans on Capitol Hill are growing increasingly restive in the aftermath of the resignation of Flynn's departure.&nbsp;Flynn's resignation Monday night came about ostensibly because he gave misleading information Vice-President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russian officials before Trump took office.But among the bigger questions swirling around the scandal are whether Flynn may have broken any laws, and who else in the campaign, or affiliated with it, had contact with the Kremlin in the run-up to the November 8 election. Trump, himself, who has frequently praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, is not above suspicion.

"I would want to make sure, with all of this suspicion, that everybody fully understood what has taken place. Otherwise, maybe there's a problem that obviously goes much deeper than what we now suspect."Dysfunctional White HouseCorker also expressed alarm over the way the administration is functioning, asking, "Is the White House going to have the ability to stabilize itself?"

"And Russia needs to pay a price when it comes to interfering in our democracy and other democracies, and any Trump person who was working with the Russians in an unacceptable way also needs to pay a price."Trump, meanwhile, continued to praise Flynn on Wednesday, calling him "a wonderful man" who has been treated "very, very unfairly by the media."He also slammed the intelligence leaks, surrounding the case, which he called "a criminal act."The White House has reportedly found a replacement for Flynn, offering the national security adviser's job to US Navy Vice Admiral Robert Harward. It was not immediately clear if Harward, a former deputy commander of US Central Command, would accept the offer.rs, bik/kl (Reuters, AFP)
