MUSICIAN, Edith WeUtonga will embark on a countrywide tour to market her forthcoming 10-track-album ahead of its release scheduled for August. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKOEdith WeUtongaThis will be WeUtonga s third album after Utonga (2010) and Kwacha (2013). Utonga s manager, Elton Mjanana, told NewsDay that the shows, scheduled to run until the end of March, would familiarise fans with WeUtonga s new Afro-fusion style. At the moment, it (the album) has no name, but it s simply a bunch of recorded songs. We intend to embark on shows, giving audiences the taste of our new style and music, he said.Only five songs Sadza, Time, Chimugwededza, Wandifadza and Kakata will be pre-released before August. We have secured a permanent slot on Thursday at Jazz 24/7 and we are getting enquiries from other promoters for more. The aim is to jam at least three shows weekly, to keep the band going and building a following at the same time, Mjanana said.He said the delay in releasing the album was due to the need to give fans quality music, rather than flooding the market with poor material. There had to be a strategy and deliberate move to introduce music that s of Edith s nature, Mjanana said, adding that WeUtonga collaborated with over a dozen local and international acts on singles and commissioned albums ahead of the forthcoming release.WeUtonga told NewsDay that she had also been focusing on her education over the past few years. I need to pay more attention to my performance career this year, as I was busy setting up my academic journey at Midlands State University and our Zimbabwe Musicians Union structures last year, she said.
