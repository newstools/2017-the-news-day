At the bottom of the S dtribune on Saturday, a large, yellow banner with black words read: &nbsp;'For the people's sport of football, against those who destroy it.'Dortmund&nbsp;fans are absolutely entitled to defend the tradition of their club. But the ugly scenes that marred one of the Bundesliga's biggest games of the season&nbsp;showed a demonstration of pride isn't enough for them, they now want to&nbsp;attack the freedom of other fans to oppose those views. Not just with banners but with makeshift weapons.The assaults on&nbsp;blameless Leipzig fans must have come as a shock to the numerous people who gaze at Germany's football culture with&nbsp;envy.Even before Germany won the World Cup in 2014, the country worked&nbsp;hard to market 'the German football experience' -&nbsp;and with good reason. Cheap tickets, great atmosphere, the inclusive role fans play - and the great football. Hundreds flew in for a weekend of football at Borussia Dortmund or Schalke. It was a chance to become part of a raw football community centered around Saturday afternoons.The imposing&nbsp;yellow and black wall in&nbsp;the Signal Iduna Park is one of the main reasons so many travel to Dortmund, but there was something very&nbsp;different about it on Saturday. Even before the game, the atmosphere&nbsp;felt tenser. By the time the game&nbsp;kicked off&nbsp;it sounded louder. It turned out it was also a lot more sinister.DW's Jonathan HardingThis match&nbsp;was an opportunity&nbsp;to expel&nbsp;a hatred that has been bubbling under ever since Leipzig arrived in the Bundesliga. Dortmund fans (and many football fans for that matter)&nbsp;are rightly aggrieved that this club from the east has bypassed the one rule (50+1 rule) holding the stitches of the German&nbsp;game together.&nbsp;But&nbsp;attacking, spitting or hurling abuse at others just for supporting their team is a world away from feeling wronged by an administrative body.Football violence is not a new phenomena, but the motive for these attacks is. How can it be at all acceptable to harm&nbsp;someone because you don't like the way their team is run? RB Leipzig have satisfied the yearning of&nbsp;fans in the east of Germany&nbsp;for quality, top-flight football. They've created a&nbsp;new culture - one that quite frankly is preferrable to some of the moronic elements of the one they&nbsp;met on Saturday. Whether Leipzig have played by&nbsp;the rules is a different question.German FA (DFB) President Reinhard Grindel has called for a change in the culture of violence in German football. There needs to be an end to the culture of violence, not a change. No one is asking for the emotion of football to be lost, but there is a world of difference between emotional support and physical&nbsp;rage.
