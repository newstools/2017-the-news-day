Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely appeared to ignore Washington's latest criticism of Israel's settlement building in the occupied territories, in a statement on Friday."The White House itself holds that the settlements are not an obstacle to peace and they never have been," Hotovely said, adding that, "It must be concluded, therefore, that expansion of construction is not the problem."Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, insisted the comments by White House spokesman Sean Spicer did not amount to "a U-turn" in US support for Israeli settlements.Support softening?White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Thursday that while the Trump administration didn't think the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, "the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful." Israeli officials insist the Trump administration has yet to work out its Middle East policy&nbsp;and is unlikely to do so until Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visits Washington on February 15.The new US leader has signaled a softer stance on settlement construction than his predecessor, Barack Obama, and Netanyahu has&nbsp;been quick to play up to that new support.Analysts said that&nbsp;at one level, the comments appeared to rein in the Israeli leader, who has announced settlement expansion plans since Trump took office. But on closer reading, the statement was a softening of policy from the Obama administration and even that of Republican former President George W. Bush.
