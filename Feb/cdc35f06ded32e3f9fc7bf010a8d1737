Thomas Greiss won the first all-German goaltending duel in National Hockey League history&nbsp;on Tuesday night, as his New York Islanders beat Philipp Grubauer's Washington Capitals 3-2."We just keep playing. We go for the goal instead of sitting back. We make less mistakes, get the puck out, get it deep and just play a more solid game,"&nbsp;Greiss told reporters after recording&nbsp;28 saves to&nbsp;lead the Islanders to victory and an important two points in their bid to make the playoffs.&nbsp;The win came a day after Greiss signed a new three-year contract with the Islanders, which&nbsp;is reported to be worth some $10 million (9.26 milllion euros).Grubauer made 26 saves in a losing effort for the Capitals, who are currently the NHL's top team.Meanwhile, Leon Draisaitl scored his 20th goal of the season in a losing effort, as his Edmonton Oilers lost 5-2 to the Minnesota Wild. This bettered the 19 goals that the 21-year-old first-round draft choice scored all of last season, his second in the NHL.
