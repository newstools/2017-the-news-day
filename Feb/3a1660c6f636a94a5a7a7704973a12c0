RENOWNED Fashion House, David Alford Harare, is representing Zimbabwe with its autumn-winter collection themed On the Precipice at New York Fashion Week at Studio 450, which opened at the weekend, the project s public relations and development manager, Rutendo Denise, said. BY LORRAINE MUROMORutendo DeniseDenise said the collection, which was inspired by one of the world s seven natural wonders, the Great Barrier Reef, was billed to illustrate the fascination that human beings have with the transition between life and death. It is meant to raise awareness of the destruction of one of nature s natural wonders and the power that nature has to make something look even more beautiful even when it is disintegrating, she said in a statement issued last week. It was this idea of two polar opposites, which made the fashion house begin to look into how they could bring a collection together that resembles the process of something living and dying, she said.In a bid to depict the disintegration of the coral reef, Denise said the fashion house used kaleidoscope imagery created on a mobile application. Thereafter, the images were digitally printed onto fabric and paired with water soluble fabric creating a stunning and timeless visual and tribute to one of the world s most iconic natural wonders, she said.Established in December 2014, David Alford is a contemporary minimalist Fashion House, which strives to create a new and exciting dimension to African Fashion.The house combines passed influences from fashion, art and architecture with modern-day techniques of producing clothing and accessories.Since the launch of the Brands first collection in April 2015, it has enjoyed much recognition at home and across the continent.
