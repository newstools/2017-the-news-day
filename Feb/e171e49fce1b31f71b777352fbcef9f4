The statement said the governance and institutional strengthening project aims at improving transparency and effectiveness in public finance and economic management; to contribute to economic recovery and service delivery.A bloated wage bill has turned into government s Achilles heel, as it searches for strategies to turn around a moribund economy that has remained stuck in the doldrums due to lack of fiscal prudence.

The proposed national transport master plan study is designed within the context of the newly launched national transport policy and in line with the Zimbabwe Agenda for Socio-Economic Transformation (ZimAsset 2013-2018), the statement read.The emergency power infrastructure rehabilitation project phase I and phase II, stage I aims to rehabilitate power transmission and distribution facilities throughout the country, as well as the Ash Handling Plant at Hwange Power Station.
