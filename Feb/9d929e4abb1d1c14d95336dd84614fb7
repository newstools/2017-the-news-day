It was undoubtedly a technological breakthrough. The introduction of Apple's iPhone 10 years ago revealed how under Steve Jobs' leadership a simple cell phone turned into a complex, multipurpose mobile device. (08.01.2017) President-elect Donald Trump has said he will see to it that Apple makes its iPhones at home in the US, and not in China. We take a look at what this would mean in terms of production costs and corporate profits. (23.11.2016) After the South Korean tech giant urged customers over the weekend not to use its flagship yet fire-prone smartphone, investors massively sold Samsung shares, wiping off billions of dollars in value. (12.09.2016) Apple's revenues climbed to an all-time record $78.4billion (72.6 billion euros) compared with $75.9 billion (70.3 billion euros) in the same period a year earlier, the company said Tuesday.Apple said it sold 78.3 million iPhones in the fiscal first quarter ending December 31, up five percent from the same holiday shopping period in 2015. That beat the Korean company Samsung's 77.5 million smartphones in the quarter, for the first time since 2011.On January 24, Samsung Electronics also reported a steep rise in both operating profit and net earnings for the final quarter of last year despite the humiliating Galaxy Note 7 recall that hammered the company's reputation.The South Koreans were forced to discontinue the Galaxy Note 7 in October 2016 after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire or exploding. In total, 3.1 million smartphones were taken back as authorities in the US and elsewhere banned them from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage.The Apple growth allayed concerns that iPhone sales, which account for more than two-third of the company's total revenue, were softening due to three quarters of sequential decline.The statistics come at a time when global demand for smartphones is slowing and cheaper Android alternatives are flooding the market."We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way," Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in the earnings release."We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, services, Mac and Apple Watch," Cook added.The company, however, did see its revenue in the Chinese market drop 12 percent to $16.2 billion.shs/jr (AFP, Reuters, AP)
