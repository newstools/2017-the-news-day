The UN Secretary General wants peace talks to resume in war-torn Yemen, but even as Antonio Guterres made his plea he was forced to defend his envoy from charges of bias.The UN has brokered seven ceasefires between the government and rebel forces and every one of them has failed."You know, I am a Catholic. And Catholics believe in resurrection," Guterres told reporters during a visit to the Saudi capital, Riyadh. "So if negotiations are dead they can always resurrect.
