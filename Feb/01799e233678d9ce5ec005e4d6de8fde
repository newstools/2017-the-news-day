Toshiba said Tuesday its Chairman Shegenori Shiga was stepping down from his post as the company warned it was set to book multibillion-dollar losses in its US nuclear business.&nbsp;Shares in Toshiba&nbsp;plummeted 8 percent earlier in the day&nbsp;after the Japanese firm postponed the release of financial results. The company surprised markets by saying its nine-month earnings report "had not yet become available."The drop in share value was also sparked by a report in the "Nikkei" business daily which said Toshiba was going to issue a warning to shareholders that its future was in jeopardy. On Tuesday, the company forecast a net loss of 390 billion yen ($3.4 billion, 3.2 billion euros) for the current fiscal year to March, with losses in its atomic division topping 700 billion yen.Major changes ahead?The expected loss is&nbsp;linked to problems with the value placed on a deal involving the purchase of a nuclear services company by Toshiba subsidiary Westinghouse Electric.
