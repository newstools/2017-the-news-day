The Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum in the north-central German city of Braunschweig announced Tuesday that its troves contained an unusual drawing of a dog by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669). The discovery came during a systematic digitization&nbsp;of drawings.Rembrandt created very few known drawings of animalsExperts made comparisons, including microscopic analyses, with other Rembrandt originals in Amsterdam, Paris and Vienna to confirm that the chalk drawing indeed came from the world-renowned Dutch master's hand. The museum noted how unusual the discovery was as worldwide only few drawings of animals by Rembrandt exist. The artist created them as studies for works that, particularly in the 1630s, depicted dogs as secondary motifs.Rembrandt to go on showThe museum has had the drawing in its collection since the 1770s, but it had been attributed to German artist Johann Melchior Roos (1663-1731).Museum visitors can view the work as of April 6 in the special exhibition entitled "D rer, C zanne und Du. Wie Meister zeichnen" (D rer, C zanne and You. How Masters Draw).als/kbm (with&nbsp;dpa)&nbsp;
