MUSICIAN, Njabulo Nkomo, known in music circles as Tytan, appears to have mended his management relationship with songstress, Cynthia Mare after it turned sour about a year ago, he confirmed yesterday. BY LORRAINE MUROMOCynthia MareSources privy to the duo said Nkomo and Mare had been involved in a romantic relationship and this had soured their management arrangement, which then collapsed.In an interview with NewsDay, Nkomo refuted the claims, saying they only parted ways as he wanted to build his own brand, before he focused on managing other musicians. Why are you writing such an article based on speculation? My relationship with Mare was purely a business one and we parted ways in a cordial mode and all those allegations are false, he said. I stopped that management role for everyone who was in my camp last year to build my brand. The Mukoko star said he is now resuscitating his previous management deals, as he now had adequate resources. I am now taking back the products that I had stopped managing and Mare is included, he said. I am doing this in partnership with another management company that is handling my affairs. Nkomo was optimistic that his brand had matured to mentor others.However, Mare refuted claims that she would be retracing her footsteps back to Tytan s camp. Tytan is now an artiste, so managing me is not going to happen again. Managers are hired by the artiste, not the other way round. After Mukoko, he has become a recognised artiste and he is pushing more of his music. In the future we might work together on music projects and collaborations. she said.
