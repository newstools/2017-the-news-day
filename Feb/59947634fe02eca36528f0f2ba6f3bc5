FORMER Finance deputy minister David Chapfika has been dragged to court by the Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) over unpaid electricity bills amounting to $307 622. BY CHARLES LAITONDavid ChapfikaThrough its lawyers, Chihambakwe, Mutizwa and Partners, the power utility said the Zanu PF Mutoko South legislator s debt was for power supplied to his Grove Farm situated along Shamva Road in Goromonzi.Chapfika, who is also chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Finance and Economic Development, has challenged the lawsuit accusing ZETDC of breaching a contractual agreement. This [claim] is denied, the plaintiff [ZETDC] has breached the contract between itself and the defendant [Chapfika] by unilaterally disconnecting electricity supply resulting in the defendant failing to perform in terms of the contract and incurring costs, the legislator said, through his lawyers Messrs GN Mlotshwa and Company. The defendant disputes the plaintiff s entitlement to the relief sought [and] the defendant prays that the claim be dismissed with costs. In its declaration, however, the power utility detailed the places where Chapfika had used the said electricity among them, four points at his Grove Farm, Grove Farm 2 and his garden project.ZETDC said despite demand, Chapfika had failed, neglected or refused to pay the claimed amount, prompting the power utility to resort to court action. By reason of the said failure, neglect or refusal to pay the above sum/amount, the defendant is obliged to pay the said amount with interest thereon, at the rate of interest, currently 5% per annum. The matter is still pending at the High Court.
