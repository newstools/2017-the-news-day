ZIMBABWEANS have been encouraged to participate in the 100 Great Zimbabweans initiative to recognise outstanding citizenry that is being run by Alpha Media Holdings in partnership with the City of Harare and AB Communications ZiFM radio station. By STAFF REPORTERHarare City Council spokesperson, Michael Chideme, told NewsDay yesterday that the initiative was important because it allowed ordinary citizens to identify people doing great work within their communities. The significance of this project is that it will help us identify people in our communities, whose contributions are never noticed because the adjudication process is often left in the hands of a few people. But through this project, the net is cast wide to allow communities to choose their own heroes, Chideme said. As a city, we need to know Harare s 100 great people because it will help us know those individuals that are driving the city s brand. The nominations, which opened on February 1, will close on March 31.Every year NewsDay will be hosting the 100 Great Zimbabweans Awards ceremony to honour the country s outstanding citizens through the celebration of ordinary people, who have made significant contributions in their communities. Citizens are encouraged to nominate a person they believe to be a great Zimbabwean under the said categories and also state the reasons for their nomination. The person nominated could be a dedicated policeman, schoolteacher, great parent, artist or anyone who has added real, honest value to the country.The nominator must also explain how the nominated individual has defied the odds and what makes them a great leader Nominations are in the categories of rising stars (18 years and below), sports, arts and culture, media and film, civil activism, education, science and technology, environment and agriculture, business and law, health, great Diasporan, great entertainer and the people s choice and can be done via the NewsDay website.
