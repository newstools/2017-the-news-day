Fears about such a breach grew after US intelligence agencies accused Russia of interfering in&nbsp;the November US elections and may have influenced the elections to help Donald Trump get elected as president.US intelligence agencies say Russia meddled in the US vote to get Trump electedPaper ballots used in Dutch elections&nbsp;are usually counted by hand at local polling stations, before being processed electronically on a regional&nbsp;and then national level.&nbsp;The Dutch Electoral Commission this week said it was probing potential vulnerabilities in the software used in the counting phase. That followed local media reports that&nbsp;weaknesses in the system made it easy to hack into.Some 12.6 million Dutch voters are eligible to cast ballots in the election, which is taking place as far-right and populist parties gain momentum across Europe. The anti-immigration and anti-EU Freedom Party, led by Geert Wilders, has been leading opinion polls for months in the Netherlands and is expected to win the most seats&nbsp;in the March vote.&nbsp;nm/sms (Reuters, AP, AFP)&nbsp;&nbsp;
