In 2017, Greeks face higher consumption taxes, income taxes, and lower pensions. The changes are meant to increase Greece's primary budget surplus, and so leave more money for debt servicing. (02.01.2017) One day after eurozone approval of short-term debt relief measures, Greece rejected any pressure to extend its austerity program beyond 2018 as part of a deal to bridge differences between its international creditors. (06.12.2016) On his final international tour as US president, Barack Obama has advocated for debt relief for Greece. The Greek prime minister is counting on Obama to deliver that message to Chancellor Angela Merkel later this week. (15.11.2016) Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has said differences between the EU and the IMF on Greece's debt management are damaging the country. He called on the EU to recognize the Greek debt crisis as a "European problem." (11.09.2016) Greece's finance minister has sent Christmas e-cards to staff featuring the Charles Dickens character Ebenezer Scrooge. The move is a dig at international lenders who have pushed Greece into deep austerity. (25.12.2016) Tsakalotos insisted Greece was moving "to a state of solid economic recovery," in a letter responding to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) latest assessment on the debt-laden country's economy.The Greek finance minister took issue with the fund's long-delayed analysis, which suggested that Athens is relying on overly optimistic calculations for its growth and budget&nbsp;estimates.Lender not convincedWhile the IMF acknowledges that the Greek economy should grow about 2.7 percent this year after just 0.4 percent in 2016, it disputes whether Greece can deliver a primary balance, or budget surplus before debt repayments, of 3.5 percent of GDP.That figure is far in excess of the 1.5 percent the IMF believes is feasible."Reaching and sustaining such a high surplus for an extended period will be challenging ... and given that double-digit unemployment rates are expected to persist for several decades," the fund's Article IV review said.But Tsakalotos answered that the argument that "Greece cannot sustain high fiscal surpluses that surpass 1.5 percent of GDP is in contradiction to recent developments."Eurogroup sides with AthensEurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem also waded into the row, accusing the IMF of being surprisingly pessimistic over the health of the Greek economy.Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos thinks lenders are overly pessimistic about the country's future"It's surprising because Greece is already doing better than that report describes," Dijsselbloem,&nbsp;who chairs meetings of eurozone finance ministers,&nbsp;told Dutch television.He said Greece's creditors, which include both the IMF and eurozone states, would be prepared to ease the terms of debt repayments further if Athens continued to cooperate on reforms. But he ruled out any relief on principal debt.Months of bickering have delayed progress on Greece's 86 billion euro ($92.4 billion) bailout program agreed in 2015.Greek leaders want to avoid a repeat of the national bank closures in 2015While European officials insist that the IMF participate&nbsp;in the bailout, the fund says it will not lend more unless the country's long-term debt is sustainable, and that requires further substantial debt relief and realistic budget targets.'No more austerity'Meanwhile, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzannakopoulos said the country was opposed to IMF demands for a contingency austerity program after the current bailout program ends next year.The Athens government&nbsp;needs to agree with the IMF and its European creditors on more reforms in order to keep tapping the bailout funds and avoid the renewed possibility of default.But deep divisions remain, with Greece refusing to implement new labor reforms and the IMF at odds with European lenders over the extent to which the country's massive debts should be eased.
