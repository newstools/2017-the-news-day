ILLEGAL setters occupying a site popularly known as KwaFarai, which is reserved for building schools in Glen Norah will soon be evicted, Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere told Parliament on Wednesday. BY VENERANDA LANGAThe minister was responding to a question from Glen Norah MP, Webster Maondera, who wanted to know government s position on an illegal settlement at Glen Norah High 2 Secondary School.A land baron is said to have been illegally parcelling out the stands, duping people of their hard-earned cash. A site known as KwaFarai is reserved for primary and secondary school use and is owned by the City of Harare, but the illegal settlers have been resisting the 48-hour notices issued to vacate the land, Kasukuwere said. Summons are currently being prepared to obtain a court order to evict the illegal settlers because the efforts by the local authority and Zimbabwe Republic Police to enforce the eviction order were hindered by the illegal occupants, who had allegedly armed themselves with weapons like petrol bombs and guns resisting eviction, Kasukuwere said.He said, in the meantime, efforts to identify the culprit are ongoing and once confirmed, law enforcement agents will be requested to arrest and prosecute him.On action that his ministry will take to bring to book land barons, who have been illegally parcelling out council land, the minister said a draft policy was being prepared and tested for effectiveness in areas such as Chitungwiza that suffered a lot of malpractices by land barons. Among the measures being proposed are public awareness campaigns to conscientise the public on the risks associated with illegal land dealings and seeking the assistance of law enforcement agents to arrest and prosecute all those found to be involved in underhand land dealings. He said the ministry was utilising the services of the judicial system through issuance of relevant court orders to evict and demolish the resultant illegal structures, as well as improving access to stands to the general public.But Maondera said the land barons were well known Zanu PF operatives.Kasukuwere said he will ensure the law takes its course on all corrupt land barons.
