Flights in and out of Berlin's two commercial airports are likely to face delays as ground staff go on strike in a dispute over pay. Train cancelled? Flight delayed by three hours? That's annoying, but at least there's usually compensation. Do you know your rights? (22.03.2016) The opening of Berlin's problem-plagued project, Brandenburg Airport, will not take place in 2017 as planned. The inauguration of the BER airport has already been delayed by six years. (21.01.2017) About 210 flights were canceled at Berlin's two main airports on Thursday as ground staff vowed to strike over pay negotiations.Trade union Verdi announced walkouts at Tegel and Sch nefeld airports from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. local time, including some 156 cancellations at Tegel and 54 at Sch nefeld airports.A strike last week caused more than 130 flight cancellations.The union issued an open letter to passengers saying they regretted the delays and flight cancellations&nbsp;but put the blame on the airlines and ground services providers."The cost of ground handling services on an airline ticket is 10 percent on average," the letter reads. "This is 10 euros ($10.64) for a 100 euro ticket. An increase of about 10 percent would cost only 1 euro more per ticket."The union was calling for a pay rise from about 11 euros an hour to 12 euros within a year. Management offered 10-cent increases each year for the next four years.The airports issued a warning to passengers on Twitter.Ground staff jobs include checking in passengers, loading and unloading planes and directing them on the tarmac.The employers, a group of airport ground services providers, said in a statement the renewed strike was "incomprehensible" as talks were still ongoing. The next round of pay talks is due to take place on Friday.Carriers affected include Air Berlin, Lufthansa, easyJet and Ryanair among others.aw/sms (dpa, Reuters, AFP)
