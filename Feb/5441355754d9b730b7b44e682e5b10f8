I will be enrolling for mature entry. Midlands State University and Lupane State University offered me programmes and I m still deliberating on which offer to take, but by the end of the week, I would have made a decision, she said. Ndebele said she wanted to impact her community through education, just like she had done with music and dance in the past. I impacted my people through music and dance, now it s time I do so through education. I want to change a lot of things within my community. I want to show that it s never too late for one to attain their dreams, she said.The mother of three said a lot of people mocked her when she started dancing, but she did not lose her focus because she knew what she wanted out of life. Many mocked me when I started dancing, calling me names, but I kept focused, as I knew what I wanted. I got married with three kids with one hubby. I set trends and I want to be the first female artiste who dresses skimpily, but goes back to her family and holds a degree, Ndebele said.She urged fellow artistes to emulate her because education would help improve the arts sector. Let s educate ourselves to better the creative sector of the arts industry, I also urge all women to imitate me. You can do it, I am a living testimony, she said. The musician is set to release her first single of the year, Ingoma, featuring Afro-pop musician Mzoe 7 and produced by award-winning producer Oskid.
