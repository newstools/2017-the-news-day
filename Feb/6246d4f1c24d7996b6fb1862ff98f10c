Washington added 13 individuals and 12 entities to its Iran sanctions authority list, the US Treasury said on its website on Friday.The decision came days after the White House put Tehran "on notice" over Sunday's&nbsp;test of a medium-range ballistic missile,&nbsp;and for supporting Shiite rebels in&nbsp;Yemen.Some of the entities listed are based in the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and China, and the sanctions affect nationals of those countries as well as Iran."Iran's continued support for terrorism and development of its ballistic missile program poses a threat to the region, to our partners worldwide, and to the United States," said John Smith, acting director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.US President Donald Trump has signaled that he&nbsp;will take a tougher tone with Tehran, tweeting on Friday that they were "playing with fire," and&nbsp;that the Obama administration had been too "kind."No US business dealingsFriday's move freezes any assets the sanctioned parties might have in&nbsp;US&nbsp;banks and prohibits US companies and people from doing business&nbsp;with them.Iran's missile test was done to provoke the US, says political scientist Ali Fathollah-Nejad in an interview with DW. Now the US can exploit the situation for its own interests - possibly to instigate armed conflict. (02.02.2017) The US has put Iran 'on notice' after the Islamic republic's military tested a ballistic missile. The statement from President Donald Trump's new national security adviser is seen as a sign of a tougher approach to Iran. (01.02.2017) Some Iraqi leaders have gone as far to call for the expulsion of all US nationals. Iran will implement a travel ban on US citizens but unlike Trump's policy, anyone with a visa will still be allowed entry. (29.01.2017) A US bill extending sanctions on Iran gives Trump a tool to rachet up pressure, but that might strengthen hardliners in Tehran. Iran has already upped its rhetoric ahead of elections next year. (15.12.2016) Among those sanctioned were companies,&nbsp;individuals, and brokers Washington said support a trade network run by an Iranian businessman, Abdollah Asgharzadeh.A&nbsp;Lebanon-based&nbsp;network was also targeted which the US Treasury said was&nbsp;run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite&nbsp;military body that is also powerful in Iranian politics and the&nbsp;economy.'Iran won't start a war'Ahead of the new sanctions, Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said Tehran was "unmoved by threats," adding that "we'll never initiate war, but we can only rely on our own means of defense."Iran has test-fired several ballistic missiles since the nuclear deal in 2015, but the latest test was the first since Trump became president.The new sanctions&nbsp;come just a year after international sanctions were lifted following a landmark deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.&nbsp;None of the new restrictions&nbsp;appear to reverse the lifting of sanctions as part of that&nbsp;deal.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the action will almost surely increase tensions with Tehran.Iran insists it has the right to conduct ballistic missile tests now that its nuclear program has been curtailed."The amateur and irrational policies of the new US&nbsp;administration&nbsp;will change nothing about the principles of Iranian politics," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.Responding to news of the sanctions, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he "understood" Washington's reaction, adding that "clearly,&nbsp;these&nbsp;missile tests violate all relevant UN Security Council resolutions."
