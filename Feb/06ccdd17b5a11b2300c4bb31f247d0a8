Last year, the figure dropped to 280,000, according&nbsp;to the Interior Ministry. The influx has resulted in a boost in the construction sector as new homes have to be built quickly to accommodate the newcomers.Most economists are confident that the economic expansion will carry through into 2017. Commerzbank Chief Economist J rg Kr mer said he expected a strong performance in the first quarter of the year amid healthy demand for German goods abroad.So far, it has remained unclear to what extent the new administration in the US may spell trouble for the German economy and German exporters in particular.US President Donald&nbsp;Trump's protectionist agenda has unnerved traditional allies in the European Union, including Germany, with many EU member countries&nbsp;fearing hefty import tariffs. In November 2016, the most recent month with country-by-country statistics, sales to the US accounted for just over 12 percent of German exports.hg/jd (dpa, AFP)
