Oppenheim economist Ulrike Kastens said in a statement, adding she now expected quarterly growth of around 0.6 percent in the first quarter of 2017, after a 0.5-percent expansion in the final three months of last year.ING Diba analyst Carsten Brzeski warned "the coming months will definitely bring some negative surprises," pointing to the start of Brexit negotiations."Even so, today's data suggest that German industry could shift into higher gear in the first quarter."Separate data from the German VDMA industry association showed on Monday that engineering orders fell by a staggering 15 percent on the year in real terms in December, driven by weaker demand from abroad and thus showing a completely different picture.The overall strong orders figures followed mixed data after German business morale unexpectedly fell in January, signaling a more downbeat assessment of the outlook for Europe's largest economy.hg/jd (AFP, Reuters)&nbsp;
