The rockets reportedly landed in the empty parade grounds at the center of the compound.It was not immediately clear who fired the shells.Demands for electoral reformThousands of supporters of prominent Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr had gathered in the capital's Tahir Square, demanding&nbsp;a complete overhaul of the electoral commission ahead of September's provincial elections. Sadr's supporters have accused the body supervising national ballots of&nbsp;being affiliated with&nbsp;political parties, therefore making it anything but independent.Sadr has vowed to step up the political pressure ahead of September's vote. In a statement effectively sanctioning the demonstrations, Sadr wrote that "if you want to approach the gates of the Green Zone to affirm your demands and make them heard to those on the other side of the fence ... you can." However, the cleric warned supporters against breaking into the compound.The electoral commission said it had asked for protection from both the prime minister's office and international community in the wake of the growing unrest.Protesters broke into the Green Zone twice in 2016, storming the prime minister's office and the parliament building.The head of the electoral commission, Serbat Mustafa, hit back at Sadr in an interview with Iraqi television Saturday afternoon. Mustafa said he would not offer his resignation and accused the cleric of using the commission as a political "scapegoat."
