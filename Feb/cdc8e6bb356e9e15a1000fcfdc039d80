BY JAIROS SAUNYAMAJah PrayzahThe country s leading meat company last year launched an open air braai place at the 64km peg along the Harare-Mutare Highway, which has since become popular with travellers as well as entertainment lovers.Sungura ace, Alick Macheso performed at the launch.Jah Prayzah will share the stage with Pengaudzoke frontman, Faheem Somanje and fast-rising jazz artiste, Calvin Mtukudzi.Surrey Group national sales manager, Ranganayi Zihumo confirmed the gig and said they had secured more braai stands to avoid braai space shortage as experienced at the last event. Jah Prayzah will be the first to perform at the Braai Open Space this year on February 18. The event gained popularity during the launch and we have been asked by patrons to bring in Jah Prayzah, and we just did that. This is a family show that will see each entrant getting a braai pack at the gate, he said. To avoid commotion at the braai stands, we have secured more portable braai stands and together with the built-ins, we have a total of 35 stands. At the gate, adults will fork out $5 and get a braai pack.Also, children will be treated to a line-up of interesting activities. According to Surrey, the braai fest will be held after every two months. We learnt a lot at the launch and we have improved a lot this time for the best of our patrons. As a leading abattoir, the patrons are assured of abundant meat, Zihumo said. When Macheso came, about 2 500 people attended and we are expecting the number to double, come February 18.
