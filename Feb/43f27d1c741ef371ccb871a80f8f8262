Police carried out multiple pre-dawn raids in the state of Hesse&nbsp;on Wednesday, targeting dozens of properties and arresting a Tunisian suspected of creating a&nbsp;network planning a terror attack in Germany. Prosecutors also said the&nbsp;36-year-old male&nbsp;was suspected of playing a role in the 2015 terror attack on the Bardo Museum in the Tunisian capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;The raid involving some 1,100 police targeted 54 homes, businesses and mosques.&nbsp;Sixteen suspects aged between 16 and 46 years old are under investigation&nbsp;for being&nbsp;members of a foreign terrorist group and planning to carry out attacks, authorities said. Prosecutors said the plans were in the early stages and there was no indication that a specific target had been selected.The prime suspect, a Tunisian man, has been under suspicion since August 2015, when he arrived in Germany as an asylum seeker.&nbsp;He is suspected&nbsp;of being a recruiter and smuggler for the so-called "Islamic State" (IS) and building up a network to plan and carry out terror attacks.He had already lived in Germany from 2003 to 2013, but returned in&nbsp;August 2015&nbsp;using an alias, prosecutors said. In August 2016, he was then arrested to carry out the remainder of a previous 2008 sentence for bodily harm. Once his 43-day sentence was finished the Tunisian was detained pending&nbsp;deportation to his homeland.During this time Tunisia sought his extradition.&nbsp;But after Tunisia failed to provide documents within the required timeframe, authorities were forced to release him in&nbsp;November 2016 after the maximum 40 days in pre-deportation detention, prosecutors said. He was then kept under 24-hour police surveillance.&nbsp;Tunisian authorities suspect the man was involved in planning and carrying out the 2015 terror attack on the&nbsp;Bardo Museum in Tunis, which killed more than 20 people, mostly&nbsp;foreign tourists. He is also suspected of involvement in an attack on the border town of&nbsp;Ben Guerdane in March 2016.Tunisian authorities on Wednesday were reported to have requested the man's extradition.&nbsp;The raids in Hesse came hours after police arrested three people suspected of links to IS at a Berlin mosque&nbsp;late Tuesday. Anis Amri, the Tunisian who killed 12 people in an attack on a Berlin Christmas market&nbsp;on December 19,&nbsp;also&nbsp;had links to the mosque, authorities said.A number of terror attacks in Germany over the past year prompted a crackdown on suspected terror networks and a review of security policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
