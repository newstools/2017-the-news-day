THE Civil Protection Unit (CPU) has warned people staying along Manyame River s catchment area to guard against being swept away by flash floods, as all the five dams on the river system have spilled. BY STAFF REPORTER The river is not only in flood, but is also characterised by swift currents. These currents are strong, thus, can easily drag and sweep away people, canoes and anything that ventures into the river. A number of people have been marooned and some swept away, the CPU said in a statement yesterday. Hydrological reports indicate that all dams on the river system have been spilling for the last two weeks. These dams include Chivero, Darwendale, Seke, Harava and Bhiri. The catchment area of this river system has so far received up to 200% of normal rains. The warning comes as some suburbs in Harare, Chitungwiza and Norton have been hit by flash floods, affecting mostly houses built on wetlands or low-lying areas.
