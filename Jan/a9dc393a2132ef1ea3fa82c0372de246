BY SPORTS REPORTERCaps United attacker Abbas Amidu (left) tussles for possession with Zanaco defender Zimiseleni MoyoFollowing their loss to another Zambian side Red Arrows on Friday, the Green Machine bounced back through goals by goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda, who blasted his side in front on 23rd minute with a trademark freekick.Abbasi Amidu then doubled the lead in the 59th minute, before the hosts pulled one from the penalty spot by Saith Salsa, their second of the match.The Zambians, who hit the bar twice in the match, were controversially awarded the two penalties. The referee adjudged that Zanaco striker, Enerst Mbewe had been brought down in the box, although it looked like he tripped himself with no defender near him. Augustine Mulenga hit the crossbar from the resultant kick.For the second one, Dennis Dauda was said to have handled inside the box, and Salsa made no mistake this time around.Unlike in the Friday match, Caps United were more fluid in their play and could have taken the lead as early as the fifth minute, an unmarked Phineas Bhamusi shot wide from a good range.New man, Ronald Chitiyo was thrust into the first 11, together with Joel Ngodzo, and had a good game.He could have put himself on the scoresheet in the 55th minute, but a superb save from Zanaco goalkeeper Racha Kola denied him his first goal for Caps United.It was United s third friendly match, having also played against Mozambique champions Ferroviario Beira, whom they defeated 2-0 at the National Sports Stadium a fortnight ago.They are using the matches to prepare for their Caf Champions League preliminary round fixture against Lesotho minnows Lioli next month.If they advance, as is hugely expected, they will face off African football giants TP Mazembe in the first round.If they lose in the first round, they will be relegated to the Caf Confederations Cup, where they will be required to participate in a play-off round.The preliminary round ties of the Caf Champions League will be played on the weekends of February 10 to 12 and 17 to 19.
