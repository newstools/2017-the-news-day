BY Stephen ChadengaCommissioning the newly-built houses last Thursday, Muzvidziwa said the university was committed to improving the welfare and living conditions of its workers and students.Some of the houses will also accommodate interns on attachment at the farm.

We are also committed to the welfare of our staff irrespective of their locations hence the reason you see us building houses at this farm. Gwenoro Farm used to be owned by the late former Rhodesia Prime Minister, Ian Smith before MSU took it over in 2013 after it was gazetted for compulsory acquisition by the government.Operations at the farm include a citrus plantation, cattle ranching as well as providing opportunities for research on agricultural-related studies.
