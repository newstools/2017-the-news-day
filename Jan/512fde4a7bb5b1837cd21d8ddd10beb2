In a statement issued on Tuesday, the two companies announced their tie-up, saying that Daimler planned to "introduce self-driving vehicles on Uber's global ridesharing network in the coming years." The statement, however, didn't reveal any financial details of the cooperation.Daimler chief executive (CEO) Dieter Zetsche said that the "inventor of the automobile" would aim to become a leader in autonomous driving, which was "one of the most fascinating aspects of reinventing mobility."San Francisco-based Uber has invested heavily in self-driving car technology in recent years and is currently piloting the use of autonomous vehicles in the US city of Pittsburgh. But it had no car-building experience, CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick admitted, which was why he was "opening up the Uber platform" to automakers like Daimler."Self-driving technology holds the promise of creating cities that are safer, cleaner and more accessible. But we can't get to that future alone," he said.Uber is already working with Sweden-based Volvo Cars to develop self-driving cars for sale by 2021. It has already built a self-driving truck which successfully delivered a beer shipment in October.
