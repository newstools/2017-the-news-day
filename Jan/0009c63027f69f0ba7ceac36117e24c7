HIGH-FLYING interdenominational gospel outfit, ZimPraise, will celebrate its 10th anniversary with the launch of their much-awaited Season 9 Pentecost Live DVD on February 2 at Ster-Kinekor, Eastgate in Harare. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOJoseph MadziyireAlthough the 80-member award-winning choir has faced numerous challenges, ranging from controversies and ownership squabbles, it has emerged as one of the best choirs in the country under the stewardship of Joseph Madziyire.The choir s popularity continues to grow locally and internationally, having performed in countries such as the United Kingdom, Dubai, the United States and Canada.The forthcoming live DVD, that was recorded at the Harare Gardens during ZimPraise s International Gospel and Music Festival last year in October, features South Africa s Joyous Celebration co-founder, Jabu Hlongwane, and another gospel musician, Sipho Makhabane.Speaking to NewsDay, the choir s spokesperson, Tendai Zhou, said the two-in-one event, that will be a red-carpet-and-black-tie occasion, will also be used to premiere the DVD, then later, performances by the choir alongside other gospel artistes. The launch has limited seating, so people must purchase their tickets on time, he said. For this year, our live DVD will carry over 25 songs that have been arranged by our music director and chief executive officer, Joseph Madziyire. The songs come in two DVD sets, which are divided as Part A and Part B. The DVDs set also has a special session, where ZimPraise performed with the renowned South Africa-based artistes Jabu Hlongwane of Joyous Celebration and Sipho Makhabane as well. Zhou said preparations for the event were going according to script, as they have been having rehearsing since November last year. The launch will be part of our 10th-year anniversary celebrations, where we will also give an insight to what we have planned for the year, he said.Madziyire told NewsDay that featuring Hlongwane and Makhabane on the DVD confirmed the interdenominational choir s vision to unite people and spread the gospel through music. The choir was established to unite various denominations in Zimbabwe through song and worship and our concerts are designed in such a way that allows people not only to be entertained, but to be ministered to and experience the power and word of God through music, he said.
