The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator said Donald Trump's presidency is the newest threat to the European Union.Speaking to a group of scholars at a public policy institute in London, Guy Verhofstadt said the EU is facing a three-pronged attack from radical&nbsp;Islamists, Russia's Vladimir Putin and now US President Trump."I have just come back from US and my view is that we have a third front that is undermining the EU... and that is Donald Trump," Verhofstadt said in a speech at the Chatham House think-tank."Trump spoke very favorably of the fact that also other countries will want to break away from the European Union, and that he hoped for a disintegration of the European Union," he added.

From 1988 to&nbsp;1992, he was a deputy executive secretary at a small UN agency, known as the Economic Commission (UNECE) for Europe in Geneva. The UNECE pushes for economic cooperation among its members and has a modest budget of $50 million (47 million euros).
