ZANU PF national youth leader, Kudzai Chipanga, reportedly lost goods worth about $15 000 when his 12-roomed farmhouse in Headlands went up in smoke on Wednesday, amid speculation the suspected arson was politically-related. BY KENNETH NYANGANIKudzanai ChipangaChipanga confirmed the incident yesterday, but ruled out foul play, saying the fire, which occurred at his Workfield Farm, could have been caused by an electrical fault. Yes, I lost a 12-roomed house. The house was razed down by fire and we suspect an electrical fault to have caused the fire. We made a police report and they said they were investigating the matter. Luckily, there was no one in the house. I lost household goods worth almost $15 000, he said.But Zanu PF Manicaland provincial youth chairperson, Mubuso Chinguno, implicate a rival faction opposed to Chipanga s camp for the alleged arson. When he was given that farm, some politburo members and a minister from Makoni were against the idea. There was a time when even some senior officials incited villagers to demonstrate against Chipanga over the farm. We are not going to be intimidated, as we carry out our own independent investigations into the incident, he said.
