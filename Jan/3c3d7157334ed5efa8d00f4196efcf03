State-owned mobile operator NetOne has unveiled new data packages, as it intensifies its push to lure more subscribers on the network. BY BUSINESS REPORTER This comes after the mobile operator saw a number of subscribers choosing the network after last week s data tariff drama, in which Econet Wireless effected the floor tariff of 12 cents for voice and 5 cents per megabyte for data.The floor prices were later suspended following an outcry from subscribers.The data package will see subscribers buying 300 megabyte (MB) of data for a $1 a day.An Econet subscriber buys 250MB of data for $1, whereas a Telecel subscriber buys 300MB of data for the same price.A NetOne executive said they were taking the competition head-on for the hearts and minds of subscribers . In all this, the subscriber is the winner. After last week s outcry, operators have to meet the needs of the subscribers, the executive said.The new data package comes as NetOne has also introduced a fair usage policy on its packages like social media bundles and OneFusion, in line with the current global technological trends.The policy is meant to enhance the experience and deliver an unparalleled experience for NetOne clients.Another executive with the telecoms firm said the fair usage policy informed on the generality of customers in terms of amount of data used in the event that there is excessive usage. Even after implementation of the fair usage policy, NetOne products remain competitive and the most affordable and it will be interesting to see how competition will react to this marketing strategy by NetOne, which is premised on increasing usage of mobile data and social media in the country, they said.According to latest data from the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe, mobile data utilisation experienced a 16,1% growth in the third quarter ended September 30 2016.In the same period, voice calls declined.
