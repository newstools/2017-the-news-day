To the excited eye, a sack of colorful material scraps may appear bold with possibility, but as Prince Nuamah discovered when he began playing with his first batch of off-cuts, it takes both imagination and perseverance to refashion waste.By his own admission, after that revalatory game-changing visit to his wife's studio, he had no idea what to do with his fabric&nbsp;haul. But that was just a minor detail."I started to cut the material up," he told DW. The first finished product from his process of trial and error was a likeness of his wife."She was impressed by it and she gave me the confidence to pursue it." A treasure trove for a creative handThat was six months ago, and since then, the budding artist who earns his living working for his father's construction company,&nbsp;has spent&nbsp;every free moment honing the practice of making pictures from his wife's remnants.So many ideasThough he has always enjoyed drawing, this new venture is his first dedicated foray into the world of art. Eco-art, no less. &nbsp;He says he is brimming with ideas and that as soon as he finishes one piece, he can't wait to get going on&nbsp;the next.

"When I go to pick up all the discarded material, I always think about how much is going to waste, and it worries me."Dressed in traditional African clothDescribing nature as one of his "inspirations", he is hopeful that his response to Ghana's mounting trash heap has the power to capture people's imaginations and make them think harder about their own habits.&nbsp;As for his own, he firmly intends to continue working on his new-found "passion", and to build a substantial body of work that speaks not only for itself, but for the environment as well.
