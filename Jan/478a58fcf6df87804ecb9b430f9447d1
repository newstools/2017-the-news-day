THE Zanu PF Manicaland 21st February Movement fundraising committee has targeted newly-established diamond mining firm, Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Company (ZCDC), to bankroll President Robert Mugabe s 93rd birthday bash set to be held in Matabeleland South province next month. BY KENNETH NYANGANI This was revealed at a provincial youth executive meeting in Mutare on Sunday, where ruling party youths said they were also targeting government school buses to transport at least 10 000 youths from the province to Matopos for the celebrations.Each of the party s 10 provinces has been tasked to raise at least $25 000 for the function, with the perennially struggling parastatals expected to fork out large sums of money towards the private event. Today (Sunday), we have met to discuss the birthday of our icon, President Robert Mugabe. He has contributed immensely in our struggle. We want to find ways on how we are going to fundraise. We need buses from schools, we need fuel, so let s work hard, the fundraising committee, Manicaland provincial youth chairman, Mubuso Chinguno said. There is the Zimbabwe Consolidation Diamond Company, we should write our letters as early as possible because we want to avoid a situation where they will say that we did not notify them early. In fact, we are targeting most companies around the province. During the meeting, Chinguno urged youths to use social media to promote party programmes. We don t use social media to attack each other. Let s put it to good use, for example, promoting party programmes. We have many programmes that need to be promoted.
