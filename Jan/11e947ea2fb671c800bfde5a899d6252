The Friedrich Loeffler Institute - which made the&nbsp;discovery -&nbsp;said the strain had also been found in wild birds in Germany this week, adding that it would not be changing its bird flu risk assessment.Isolated outbreaks on farms have been occurring despite tougher hygiene rules and orders to keep poultry indoors in high-risk areas.The contagious H5N5 strain had been found previously in wild birds in the Netherlands, Italy, Montenegro, Italy, Croatia and Israel."This discovery shows how dynamic the bird flu is," state Agriculture Minister Robert Habeck said.&nbsp;"The virus is still present and is changing."Different bird flu strains have also spread in Asia in recent weeks leading to the slaughter of millions of birds in South Korea and Japan, and some human infections in China.
