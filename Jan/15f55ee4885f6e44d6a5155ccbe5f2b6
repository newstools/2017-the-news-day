Hundreds of millions of Chinese celebrated the Lunar New Year Friday into Saturday, with many tuning in to the "CCTV Spring Festival Gala."The television show was on many Chinese screens Friday night, a spectacle lasting for more than four hours, and included skits, music and dance. The show has been a yearly tradition since 1983, but has been criticized for being too nationalistic and praising the Communist party.The main celebration of the night included 11 Chinese astronauts in front of a large Chinese flag, who introduced themselves and placed their hands in clay molds. The molds will later be displayed in a museum.
