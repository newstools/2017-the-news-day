Samsung Electronics' operating profit soared by 50.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 despite the humiliating Galaxy Note 7 recall that hammered the reputation of the world's largest smartphone maker.The South Koreans were forced to discontinue the Galaxy Note 7 in October after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire or exploding. In total, 3.1 million smartphones were taken back as authorities in the US and elsewhere banned them from use on planes and even from being placed in checked luggage.Despite the disaster, Q4 net earnings rose by a staggering 120 percent year on year, mostly due to strong results in the chip-making segment.
