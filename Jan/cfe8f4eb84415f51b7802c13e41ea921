THE Premier Soccer League (PSL) is set to meet in the capital tomorrow to discuss the way forward following a resolution made by Zifa at an extraordinary general meeting recently on the relegation and promotion saga. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKAKeni MubaiwaAt the meeting, assembly members unanimously maintained that two teams would be relegated from the league, while four from the regional leagues would be promoted to play in the 2017 season.This means the league will have 18 teams next term. This has strained relations between the soccer controlling body and its affiliate, the PSL, who have resisted the resolution.The PSL prefers to have two teams going up and an equal number going down.The feud saw the PSL taking the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.Clubs had made a commitment to pay $17 000 needed by the Switzerland-based court for their matter to be heard.But their bid to continue the fight with Zifa over the issue appears to have been stalled by divisions within the clubs themselves.The majority of the clubs want to continue with the battle and tomorrow s meeting is set to discuss the way forward.Dynamos president, Keni Mubaiwa, who is also a member of the PSL committee and leads one of the few clubs opposed to the idea of continuing the fight, confirmed the meeting. A meeting on the relegation and promotion issue has been called on Friday. I have received a circular to the effect that there will be a meeting to discuss the way forward on the relegation and promotion issue. I don t have much detail on that. I am not even in the picture whether the issue is still being pursued at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, he said.The Premiership was thrown into chaos in October last year when the Zifa assembly rescinded an earlier decision to relegate two teams and promote an equal number.The four teams to win their respective leagues and stake a claim for promotion are Bantu Rovers, Shabanie Mine, Yadah Gunners and Black Rhinos.
