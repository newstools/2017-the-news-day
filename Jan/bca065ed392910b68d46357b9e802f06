RUSAPE has been hit by a water crisis after pipes at town s waterworks were swept away by flooded Rusape River last Friday. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Most parts of the town have been affected and council officials said the last time this happened was 15 years ago and it took them six months to restore normal water supplies.Rusape Town Council secretary, Joshua Maligwa yesterday said the local authority had organised an all-stakeholders meeting to map the way forward. I can confirm that our water pipes at our town waterworks were swept away by the flooded Rusape River last Friday and there is a water crisis. I am just coming from an all-stakeholders meeting over the matter, he said. Most parts of Rusape are affected and we cannot do anything because the river is flooded. We told relevant stakeholders that this is not of our own making. The last time it happened was 15 years ago and it took six months before supply was brought back, he said. We don t want to panic, but we should be aware of the challenges that we might face in the coming days. We are very alert on typhoid and cholera, among a number of issues.
