Kalisto PasuwaAgainst Senegal, we have to brave, aggressive and play the kind of football we are used to. We need to keep possession to get into their defence. We will bring another dimension and being one of the best teams on the content, it will be tough.

We hope he will be fit for the last match against Tunisia. Cuthbert Malajila
