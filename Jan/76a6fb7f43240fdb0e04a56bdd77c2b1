Mexican and US officials appealed to the public on Saturday for help in finding the gunman who wounded the official earlier that day.The shooting occurred as the official, who has not been named, was leaving a parking garage. Surveillance footage showed the gunman, dressed in blue, following the official inside the garage. While the attack appears to have been a direct attack against the man, the gunman apparently waited until the victim was exiting the garage in his car before shooting him.The video shows the gunman firing a round into the windshield before fleeing the scene. Authorities said&nbsp;the consulate officer was in a&nbsp;stable condition.The motive behind&nbsp;the shooting was&nbsp;unknown.The US Embassy in Mexico posted a tweet advertising a $20,000 (18,900&nbsp;euros) reward for information regarding the shooter's whereabouts.The embassy also said it was working&nbsp;to locate the suspect itself. "We are working closely with Mexican law enforcement in this matter," a statement from the embassy said.This isn't the first time a US consulate official has been the victim of a shooting in Mexico. In 2010, a consular official and two others were murdered by gunmen in Ciudad Juarez.blc/se&nbsp;(AP, AFP, dpa)
