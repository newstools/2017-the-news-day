BULAWAYO football giants, Highlanders have turned down a bid from Botswana top-flight outfit Extension Gunners for the services of striker, Gabriel Nyoni. BY SAKHELENI NXUMALOThe Bosso speed merchant recently spent some time with the Lobatse-based side, who went on to table an offer that Highlanders has turned down.Bosso secretary-general, Emmett Ndlovu said the Botswana outfit s offer did not meet their expectations. I cannot disclose the figures, but they (Extension Gunners) were offering too little for a player of Nyoni s calibre. As Highlanders, we sat down with the player and discussed the issue and agreed that the value of what the Botswana team was offering did not match his Highlanders deal, he said.Nyoni recently signed a two-year contract with Highlanders.Sources said Extension Gunners had promised Nyoni, who has a marketing degree, an employment opportunity in the field of his study, as part of the incentives for him to join them.Nyoni, who turns 25 in September, joined Highlanders in 2013 after impressing then coach, Kelvin Kaindu.He was loaned out to Southern Region Division One outfit, Bulawayo Chiefs, where he spent the first half of the 2013 season before reverting back to Highlanders mid-year.He was the team s chief striker last season following the departure of Knox Mutizwa and Bruce Kangwa for South African and Tanzanian sides, respectively.He is expected to lead the line again this year in the team s attack, which features youngsters Prince Dube, McCarthy Dube and Godfrey Makaruse.
