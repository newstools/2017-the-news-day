ZIMBABWE People First (ZimPF) leader, Joice Mujuru, has organised a youth campaign rally in Binga on Saturday, soon after her MDC-T counterpart, Morgan Tsvangirai met with various stakeholders in the Matabeleland North province to apprise them on the opposition parties proposed grand coalition. By KHANYILE MLOTSHWAZimPF leader Joice MujuruZimPF spokesperson, Jealousy Mawarire confirmed Mujuru will preside over the event. The president (Mujuru) is going to officiate at the event and it has now been expanded to include other organs of the party, he said.ZimPF s Matabeleland North provincial youth coordinator, Robson Melassi, told Southern Eye yesterday that the rally was meant to drum up support for Mujuru and encourage party youths to actively participate in national politics. Our position, as youth at ZimPF is clear, we want free and fair elections in 2018, he said. We want the international community to monitor our elections next year. We are, therefore, organising this rally to ensure that we mobilise young people countrywide to vote for the best candidate, who has the chance of taking this country forward, who is Joice Mujuru. Melassi said they were campaigning for decentralised development and a non-partisan allocation of national resources.He equated Mujuru to a rainbow, which appears after a big storm. We can never see the beautiful rainbow if we never had rain. Our rainbow is Mujuru, as she marks the dawn of a new Zimbabwe after three decades of living under the shadow of a party that we once cherished, as it led us to independence, which we now know was a mere word, as we have lived through tyranny, Melassi said.Mujuru and Tsvangirai have committed themselves to enter into a coalition to challenge President Robert Mugabe and his Zanu PF party in next year s general elections.
