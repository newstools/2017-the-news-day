Eastern Region Division One is a tough league, but we are confident that he will use his experience. We want to give him a chance to choose players of his choice. Rovers were relegated last season in their debut season in the top-flight league and will be hoping for a quick return.They face a tough fight for promotion in a league that includes another former PSL side Buffaloes.Buffaloes had a bruising fight for the sole promotion ticket, with Yadah last season and they will fancy themselves to be successful this time around.Buffaloes have already relocated to Rusape, a move that has irked some of their loyal fans.Buffaloes failure and the relegation of Mutare City Rovers means there will be no top-flight football in Mutare this season.
