WITH only two years in the music industry, Njabulo Nkomo better known as Tytan is making waves, which have seen him considered among the best artistes in this competitive industry. BY LORRAINE MUROMOTytanAlthough Tytan released his first two singles Faka Itshukela and Kana Waropafadzwa in 2015, the songs failed on the market and it was after he collaborated with Ammara Brown on the hit song Mukoko that he achieved fame.Since its release, the Mukoko video has had about 1,37 million views on YouTube.After the success of Mukoko, which at one point almost became a national anthem, Tytan went on to release other singles I dondi Keya and Handirare that are receiving rotational airplay on local radio stations.Speaking to NewsDay Weekender yesterday, Tytan saluted both the fans and his family for the support, but he was quick to dismiss that he was now a celebrity. I am yet to regard myself, as popular as I can walk on the streets and not cause a stir, unlike other seasoned artistes, he said. Although Tytan is optimistic that he will achieve and reach the success levels of the likes of the multi-award winner, Jah Prayzah, his family is essential in his career. My family has been supportive regarding that it is difficult in this entertainment industry to get support from the family based on cultural beliefs. I am humbled to have such a family that supports my career, he said.Tytan said he is still single and not searching, but open to a relationship. I wish I was in a relationship. I once tried to work out something last year, but it was a train wreck. At the moment I am just focused on my work, but if it happens that I meet someone along the way it is all good, he said.Despite his fame, the Mukoko hitmaker still leads the life of an ordinary man and currently stays in Prospect, Waterfalls, Harare.Tytan admitted that at the moment he does not own any vehicle and has to make use of public transport as everyone else.Apart from his music career, Tytan is a fashion designer who dresses himself.
