US Defense Secretary James Mattis has&nbsp;reassured his British counterpart of the "unshakeable commitment" the US has toward&nbsp;the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a Pentagon spokesman said&nbsp;Monday.The European Union is mesmerized by the events unfolding in Washington and is anxiously watching every step Donald Trump takes, writes DW's Max Hofmann. Less than a week on the job, Mattis also spoke with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to affirm the importance of the alliance."The two leaders discussed the importance of our shared values, and the secretary emphasized that when looking for allies to help defend these values, the United States always starts with Europe," Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis said."Both pledged to consult in the months to come and look forward to meeting in person during the NATO Defense Ministerial in February," he added.Mattis' calls to European defense officials comes less than two weeks after US President Donald Trump told&nbsp;the German daily "Bild" and&nbsp;British newspaper "The Times"&nbsp;that the alliance was "obsolete.""I said a long time ago that NATO had problems. Number one - it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago," Trump said.Afterwards,&nbsp;German Chancellor Angela Merkel rebuked Trump's remarks, saying Europe can take care of itself.

However, German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month said&nbsp;Berlin will raise its defense spending to 1.22 percent of GDP.After speaking with Mattis, British Defense Minister Michael Fallon said&nbsp;both nations would push members to meet their defense spending commitments."We talked of our joint leadership in NATO, including modernizing the alliance and how we ensure that all members meet the NATO 2 percent spending commitment," Fallon said.
