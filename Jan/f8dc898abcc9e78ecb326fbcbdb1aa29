BULAWAYO giants Highlanders kicked off their pre-season training programme yesterday minus veteran utility player, Eric Mudzingwa, who is away in South Africa for a trial stint at Premiership outfit, Baroka Football Club. BY SAKHELENI NXUMALOHighlanders technical director, Cosmas Zulu ( left) watches as Benson Phiri (centre) and Peter Muduhwa go through their pacesHighlanders secretary-general, Emmett Ndlovu told NewsDay Sport that the long-serving Bosso deputy captain had been given the greenlight to go for trials after the South African top-flight debutants expressed interest in his services. I can confirm that Eric is currently in South Africa, where he has gone for a week-long trial at Baroka after they showed interest in him, Ndlovu said.Baroka FC anchor the 16-team Premiership log table at the halfway stage of the season and recently parted ways with former Bosso striker, Cleopas Dube, who was fired for returning late from the mid-season break.Mudzingwa, who turns 31 next month, has been a very loyal servant to Highlanders and last year the club rewarded his loyalty by giving him the Longest-Serving Player Award at their end-of-season awards.Only 12 of the players that were in Highlanders books last season took part in the team s first training session yesterday morning at Barbourfields Stadium outside grounds, with veteran coach Cosmas Zulu in charge.Zulu said the other players that were not present at training had been excused because of various commitments. We had a good first day of training and I am happy with today s turnout. Just a few of our players were not present, but they had our blessing as they had commitments elsewhere, he said.A total of 20 players took part in yesterday s session with the returning players being Gabriel Nyoni, Benson Phiri, Nkosana Ndlovu, Nhlanhla Ndlovu, Brian Banda, McCarthy Dube, Adrian Silla, King Nadolo, Prosper Matutu, Thembalethu Mthunzi, Bukhosi Ncube and Peter Muduhwa.Muduhwa recently returned from a training stint at South African Premiership side Bidvest Wits, where he had gone together with Prince Dube, who Zulu said had been granted permission to rest after travelling back home.No big-name players were present among the eight players that are on trial and Zulu declined to shed light on their identities, saying rival teams would entice them away from Bosso once they found out that they were training with the Bulawayo giants.
