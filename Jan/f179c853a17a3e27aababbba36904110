THERE was drama at the Harare Magistrates Court on Monday, when a Russian man, Stephen Paul Sugden, accused of using forged documents to obtain a Zimbabwean passport, fled midway during his trial after a State witness blew the lead on his true identity. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDESudgen asked for a break mid-trial, which was granted by presiding magistrate, Tendai Mahwe, but when proceedings resumed in the afternoon, he did not show up, prompting the court to issue a warrant of arrest against him.This was after a State witness told the court that the suspect s real name was Stanislav Sytchev. The witness, who could not be named, claimed that she brought Sugden to Zimbabwe and partnered him in a family business before the latter allegedly changed his identity by acquiring local identification particulars.While explaining his client s absence, Sugden s lawyer, Rungano Mahuni, told the court he had rushed his wife to hospital. However, Mahwe refused to accept the excuse, saying it was one of the accused person s tactics to delay trial, which had almost taken three years without being completed.Mahuni also made an application seeking the postponement of the matter, saying he wanted almost a month to go through the court record of proceedings, but his application was thrown out.Asked by prosecutor, Oscar Madhume to explain how she knew Sugden, the witness said: I know the accused, not as Stephen Sugden, but Stanislav Sytchev, who was born in Russia. I am the one who brought him to Zimbabwe and I have photos to prove what I am saying. Earlier in the day, Mahwe had shot down several attempts by Sugden to stall the trial.Sugden was initially represented by Admire Rubaya, who later renounced agency.
