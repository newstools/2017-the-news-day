Stefan Kraft leads the way at the Four Hills Tournament in his native Austria after victory in Tuesday's preliminary round secured him the daily maximum of 134.5 meters (143.1 points)."This jump was really good, now I know what I have to do tomorrow", said Kraft, who still trails leader Kamil Stoch of Poland, who took the lead in the Touring Championship but has again decided not to participate in the qualification.Led by the hopeful Markus Eisenbichler, the German jumpers have entered the third contest of the four-man championship in Innsbruck at full strength.Eisenbichler was the sixth best in qualifying after a jump of 130.0 meters, gaining 136.3 points and he remains in fourth overall, which was already determined ahead of the competition on Wednesday (14.00 CET) by virtue of his World Cup placement.Stoch and Kraft will face each other in a direct duel. The loser hopes to come as one of the five so-called "Lucky losers" in the second round. The Norwegian Daniel Andre Tande completes the trio of jumpers that will be the ones to beat for the overal title.Freund does not fly far againWorld champion Severin Freund, as Eisenbichler already qualified for the competition, disappointed again and did not go above 47th place with 116.5 meters (108.1). Andreas Wellinger in ninth (128.6) and Stephan Leyhe in 12th (126.3), however, produced strong displays.Richard Freitag, who triumphed in Innsbruck in 2015, reached an average score of 25 (120.6). Karl Geiger slipped to 41st (111,1) after a weak jump, but remains in the competition.Kasai sets new milestoneNoriaki Kasai, a fading Japanese ski jumping legend, is appearing in his 100th Four Hills tour event. The 44-year-old qualified quite confidently in 24th and will therefore appear in his 94th Tournee competition on Wednesday.asz/sn/mds (sid, dpa)
