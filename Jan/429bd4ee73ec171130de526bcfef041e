DW's users have voted&nbsp;Borussia Dortmund striker&nbsp;Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang the best player in the Bundesliga in 2016.&nbsp;Aubameyang, who started 2017 playing for his native Gabon in the Africa Cup of Nations, scored 23 goals in the Bundesliga for Dortmund in the 2016 calendar year, including the 16 he has scored since the start of the current campaign. His&nbsp;nose for goal and his pace often made the difference for Dortmund over the past 12 months. The 27-year-old Aubameyang also draws attention off the pitch for his flamboyant hairstyle and clothes, and for his penchant for supercars.The Dortmund striker has triumphed over some impressive competition, particularly Robert&nbsp;Lewandowski, the man who finished second in last year's Bundesliga goal-scoring race. Coming in a distant third was versatile young Bayern star Joshua Kimmich.
