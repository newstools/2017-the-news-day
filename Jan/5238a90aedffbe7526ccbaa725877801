A ZAMBIAN play, titled The Married Virgin, by the Bantu Empire Theatre, is set to premiere early next month at Theatre in the Park in Harare. BY LORRAINE MUROMOSpeaking to NewsDay from his base in Zambia, the playwright and director, Francis Malunga said they felt honoured to be bringing their second play to Zimbabwe, having staged The Pastor and the Prostitute last year. We are excited to be staging The Married Virgin in Harare. It shows that our theatre club is growing and making positive trends. We are a powerhouse in Zambia, as the national champions and coming to Zimbabwe is a windfall, he said.Malunga said they had been working very hard, in conjunction with Theatre in the Park to perfect their art to guarantee theatre fans another treat.The play s storyline revolves around betrayal and gender-based violence, where a married man fakes his death upon realising that he was HIV positive. While he had to come clean to his wife, she is in a dilemma, as she was impregnated by the family doctor and she has to confess too.Malunga said there was need for the two countries governments to invest more in theatre and the arts, as a way of enhancing cultural exchanges. As artistes, we are mouthpieces, we speak for the voiceless, we pass on information that is critical and when people watch, it is easy for them to remember, we teach through arts, he said. There are a lot of issues that we can bring out not only through the form of entertainment, but education as well.
