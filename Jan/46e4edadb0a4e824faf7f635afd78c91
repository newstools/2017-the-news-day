BOXING superstar, Charles Manyuchi yesterday left the country for Zambia for his final preparations ahead of World Boxing Council Silver welterweight title defence. BY HENRY MHARAManyuchi (20-2-1, 12 KOs) will defend the title against challenger Qudratillo Abduqaxorov (9-0, 6 KOs) of Uzbekistan at the OCBC Arena in Singapore on March 25.The 26-year-old, who began preparations in Harare in December, left the country yesterday for camp in Lusaka, where he will intensify the training under his management team until his departure for the Asian country on March 15. My training here has been good, but I will be intensifying it so I can be in a good condition for the fight, Manyuchi said. Abduqaxorov has also been preparing hard for the match, as he seeks to pull off a major upset and grab the sought-after belt.The 23-year-old is coming off a fifth round knockout win over Romeo Jakosalem on January 7 and he will have another warm-up fight against Ukrainian Viktor Plotnykov on February 10. Every boxer is dangerous and I don t expect an easy fight. He is a quality boxer and that is why the WBC chose him to be a challenger. I will have to be very careful, reckoned Manyuchi.Manyuchi was seen off by a group of his fans. Regrettably, there were no officials from the government at the send-off function. Organisers of the fight are negotiating with Manny Pacquiao to have the global boxing icon by the ringside.
