BY KENNETH NYANGANINaaz president, Tendai Tagara told NewsDay Sport yesterday that they will announce the name of the sponsor and the finer details of the deal this week.Sources told this newspaper that a South African non-profit organisation involved in social investment programmes aimed at promoting sport, education, peace, stability, harmony and unity among people and nations, has partnered with Naaz and will sponsor an annual marathon. Our association will announce a new sponsor for road races and track this week, the deal is worth over $100 000. Getting sponsorship is one area, which we emphasised when we got into office and the results are beginning to show, Tagara said. We have agreed with our new partner that they handle their funds as part of good corporate governance. We have given them our programmes, which they will fund, in line with global trends. Tagara said Naaz was in the process of wooing more sponsors with help of the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (Zoc). We are now getting a lot of support (from Zoc). They are supportive of our programmes. Even the International Association of Athletics Federations is aware of our endeavour to build a good image with our partners. We are in discussions with a number of sponsors, and by year end, I am hoping we would have sealed more deals, he said. The challenge given to us this year is to develop more clubs in line with the ministry of Sport thrust to develop more clubs and giving more time to grassroots activities.
