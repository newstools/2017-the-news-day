On&nbsp;this week's show, our hosts&nbsp;Joy Doreen Biira in Kenya and Nneota Egbe in Nigeria take you on another journey across Africa and Europe exploring some of&nbsp;the solutions to the environmental problems of our day.&nbsp;In Zambia we meet a man working to protect fruit bats and in&nbsp;Nigeria, we visit a&nbsp;group of innovative people who are turning unwanted plants such as water hyacinths into home accessories, while offering training opportunities at the same time.&nbsp;Here in Europe, we go to Switzerland where an organic farmer finds his limits tested when faced with flocks of hungry crows.And in Germany, we dive into the world of sharing. From clothes to cars to household appliances, the big question is: do we need our own?Join us for these stories and more on eco@africa.&nbsp;
