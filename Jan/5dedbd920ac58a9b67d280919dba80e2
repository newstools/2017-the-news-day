Highlanders has been left stranded, as their bid to have chairman, Peter Dube s suspension lifted has not received a favourable response from the football supreme body, Zifa. BY SAKHELENI NXUMALOIn his vote of thanks at the conclusion of the Bulawayo giants annual general meeting on Sunday, Bosso board member, Jonathan Sayi Moyo, who played a big role in quelling a heated debate on Dube s suspension by members, who were accusing the Bosso leadership of being inconsiderate of the suspended chairman s plight, counselled the members to pray for their suspended chairman. Many of you are aware that we have got enemies and we shouldn t play into their hands, but should pray for Dube during this difficult period. We must pray that, in the end, he comes back and leads this institution, Moyo said.Ordinary Bosso members had earlier taken their leadership to task over failure to challenge the football mother body over Dube s suspension alongside the now retired former CEO Gumede last year.The members could not wait for the issue to be addressed under any other business, where it had been slotted and immediately started firing away at the club leadership at the conclusion of board chairman, Mgcini Nkolomi s report.Nkolomi s admission that they had tried to engage Zifa in writing on two separate occasions, but were yet to receive any response, was met with derision by Bosso life member, Ellington Nsingo who said: It s sad that the board chairman, the board and executive sat down and agreed that Highlanders should remain without a chairman after our chairman was suspended over PSL issues. Why should we keep trusting you? We want our chairman back when the season gets underway. Meanwhile, Highlanders net gate-takings tumbled by almost $7 000 in the 2016 season compared to the previous year.
