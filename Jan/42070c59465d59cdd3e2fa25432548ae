LEADING local hip-hop star, Tendai Tehn Diamond Nguni, is set to embark on a nationwide tour starting on February 18 dubbed Tehn Outta Ten to promote his latest album, A Few Good Poems (AFGP). BY SINDISO DUBETehn DiamondThe tour will see him staging 10 shows in different cities across the country.The album was released on digital music distribution sites early this month and has been doing well, with tracks such as Daijes in the Sky and No Stress receiving positive spins on national radio stations.The prolific songwriter, rapper and singer will be supported by Ammara Brown, Simba Tagz and Thaiwanda Thai, alongside hip hop promoter, Zimboi, whom he partnered for the tour.Tehn DiamondThe Happy hit maker starts the tour with a performance at Stars Night Club in the capital, before travelling to Mutare, Bulawayo, Marondera, Kadoma, Gweru, Zvishavane, Masvingo, Chinhoyi and wraps it up in Chitungwiza on March 24. Although I will be promoting my latest album through this tour, what is important is to get hip hop to a state, where it can compete on a continental scale, Tehn Diamond said. If we can have our own people supporting the genre, it then makes it easier to export. Zim hip hop must be represented on Africa s big stages like the MTV Base and the call is for the genre s followers to support the movement. Tehn Diamond made his name in 2013, when he joined hands with Jnr Brown and producer Take Fizzo to form a rap clique, a Few Kings, which won a number of awards, with their hits Happy, Summer and Realness.
