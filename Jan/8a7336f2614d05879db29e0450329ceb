In a tweet on Wednesday, newly-inaugurated US President Donald Trump, said he would be asking for a "major investigation into voter fraud."According to Trump, the investigation&nbsp;would include anyone "registered to vote in two states, those&nbsp;who are illegal and ...&nbsp;even, those registered to vote who are dead [and many for a long time].""Depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures!" Trump said.The tweets on Wednesday came just hours after a press conference in which&nbsp;White House spokesman Sean Spicer&nbsp;said Trump's belief&nbsp;that millions of people had voted illegally in the November election&nbsp;was&nbsp;based on "studies and evidence." He&nbsp;did not, however, provide examples."I think he's stated his concerns of voter fraud, and people voting illegally during the campaign, and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him."During the transition period after the November vote,&nbsp;Trump claimed&nbsp;he would have won the popular vote as well as the Electoral College vote that secured his victory had it not been for people voting illegally.

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the most senior Republican in Congress, said he had seen no evidence to back up Trump's claims.Fact-checking website Politifact debunked the claims in November, and other independent studies found that incidents of voting fraud were likely isolated and were unlikely to occur on such a large scale.Senator Bernie Sanders, who lost the Democratic Party nomination to Hillary Clinton, said Trump was sending a message to Republican state governors&nbsp;to go forward with voter suppression."The great political and democratic crisis we face now in this country is not voter fraud, it is voter suppression. And it is my belief we have to do everything we can to make sure that everybody in this country who is legally able to vote is able to vote," Sanders told ABC News.Series of policy decisionsTrump's&nbsp;comments came as he made significant policy decisions in the opening days of his administration.Earlier Tuesday,&nbsp;Trump signed presidential memorandums&nbsp;to advance construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline from Canada into the United States and the Dakota Access pipeline, both of which had been blocked by his predecessor Barack Obama over environmental concerns.
